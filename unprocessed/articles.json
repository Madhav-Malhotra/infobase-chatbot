A Canadian look at the connection between childhood maltreatment and diabetes Published: (2017-02-21) What we know Child abuse may hurt the body for years after it ends. Reducing child abuse, then, will not only reduce immediate pain, injury and suffering, but may also improve adults\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long-term physical health. Child maltreatment, including physical and sexual abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence, is a serious public health issue. The links between childhood abuse and teenagers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and adults\u00e2\u0080\u0099 psychological problems, such as suicidal ideation and attempts, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse, are well known [Afifi et al., 2014]; [Tonmyr & Shields, 2016]. Current research is focusing on the lesser known long-term consequences of child maltreatment and the development of chronic physical health conditions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChildhood experiences, both positive and negative, have a tremendous impact on future violence victimization and perpetration, and lifelong health and opportunity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [CDC, 2016] Findings from the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Study from the US support the link between adverse childhood experiences, and certain long-term chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes in adulthood. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis using the ACEs found that adverse childhood experiences, including physical abuse, sexual abuse or neglect, were associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adulthood. This is thought to be due to ACEs acting as chronic stressors on the body by triggering elevated levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, glucose and insulin in the blood as well as other markers of inflammation. [Huang et al., 2015] Studies from Canada are showing similar findings. What we looked at Some people experience more severe child maltreatment than others. People might get hit once, or repeatedly, with or without dangerous objects. Similarly, sexual abuse may happen only once or may continue, and may involve more or less intrusive acts. New research allows the exploration and better understanding of the importance of severity to health outcomes later in life. The 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mental Health (CCHS-MH) was nationally representative and included responses from over 25,000 Canadians. A recent study based on the CCHS-MH [Shields et al., 2016] found that childhood maltreatment was associated with diabetes. In the survey, respondents were asked to report on long-term health conditions diagnosed by a health professional. Adults were also asked a series of questions about experiences of childhood physical or sexual abuse or exposure to intimate partner violence before they were 16 years old. What we found The study found that the frequency (e.g. if the abuse happened more than three times), the type of abuse (physical, sexual or both) and the severity of the abuse (e.g. punching, choking or burning) seemed to affect the risk of developing diabetes. Specifically the study found that: Those who frequently experienced severe childhood sexual abuse were twice as likely to have diabetes than those who did not experience childhood sexual abuse. Experiencing more than one type of childhood abuse increased the likelihood of having diabetes as an adult. Those who frequently experienced severe childhood physical and sexual abuse were over two times more likely to have diabetes than those who experienced no abuse of either type. To verify the connection between childhood maltreatment and diabetes, we isolated the effects of other known factors that contribute to the risk of developing diabetes such as obesity, smoking status, physical activity level, high blood pressure, age, gender, and income. After this verification, the connection between childhood maltreatment and diabetes remained. Few studies have examined associations between childhood maltreatment and diabetes using large population-based samples. Therefore studies such as this one, of a representative sample of Canadian adults, are important in highlighting the life-long health consequences of experiencing family violence in childhood. What this means for public health Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in Canada and increases the risk of developing a number of additional long-term health issues such as heart disease and stroke. The proportion of Canadians living with diabetes has almost doubled from 6% in 2000 to 10% in 2011. Understanding the role of childhood maltreatment as a risk factor for diabetes, and other life-long health issues, is needed in order to inform treatment of this illness. It also underscores the need to focus on both research and evidence based prevention efforts to address violence against children in the family setting. Working to reduce child maltreatment now could have positive mental and physical health implications for Canadians down the road. Report a problem or mistake on this page Date modified: 2017-02-21"

Trends of alcohol use among grade 7 to 12 Canadian students from the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS), formerly the Youth Smoking Survey (YSS), are also presented. Canadians 15 years of age and older Canadian students in grades 7 to 12 About three quarters of Canadians report consuming alcohol in the past year (Figure 1) The prevalence of past-12-month alcohol use remained relatively stable among Canadians, 15 years of age and older, ranging from 76% to 78% between 2008 and 2017. While the prevalence of past-12-month alcohol use has been relatively stable among males, it increased slightly among females between 2008 and 2017. Among females, the prevalence of past-12 month alcohol use increased slightly among those 25 years and older, while it remained stable among 20 to 24 year olds and declined by 17% among 15 to 19 year olds.

Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS) on behalf of Health Canada. Notes on the data The Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS) is a biennial general population survey that collects information on substance use among Canadians aged 15 years and older. The survey is conducted in the 10 Canadian provinces excluding the territories. CTADS replaced the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS) that was conducted from 1999 to 2012, and the Canadian Alcohol and Drug Use Monitoring Survey (CADUMS) that was conducted from 2008 to 2012. CTADS was launched in 2013 and ran for 3 cycles until 2017. In 2019, CTADS was split into two surveys, a new tobacco survey, and the Canadian Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CADS) that was implemented in 2019. References Footnote 1 Health Canada.

        "content": "\u00c3\u0097 Close survey overlay Antimicrobial Resistance in Canada: Findings from the 2022 Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System Report Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top 10 global public health issues. Many existing antimicrobial drugs, such as antibiotics, are becoming less effective at treating infections, and drug-resistant pathogens continue to emerge. Resistance can develop naturally over time; however, the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine has greatly accelerated its emergence and spread across the human, animal and food chain. Antimicrobials are instrumental in medical advances and saving lives. Without effective antimicrobials, our ability to fight infectious diseases will significantly decline. The Public Health Agency of Canada integrates and synthesizes information from its various surveillance systems and laboratory reference services that cover human, animal and food to present data on antimicrobial resistance and use in the human (hospital and community) and animal settings. The full 2022 Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) report presents data between 2016 and 2021. Antimicrobial Resistance in Humans Antimicrobial resistance for most priority organisms continued to increase over a five-year period. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infections: 2016-2020 The overall rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections increased, driven by increases in community-associated infections since 2017. Nearly 1 in 6 (17.5%) patients diagnosed with MRSA BSI died within 30 days of diagnosis (all-cause mortality). Figure 1. Incidence rates of overall, healthcare-associated and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, CNISP, 2016-2020. Table 1.

Figure 5: Text description Antibiotic Bacterial species Antibiotic Use and Frequency Antibiotic use is very common. About a third of Canadians (33.9%) reported antibiotic use in the past 12 months, 2021-2022. More than 1 in 7 used antibiotics twice or more. Close to 1 in 20 used antibiotics more than five times. In 2008, 38.0% of Canadians reported having taken antibiotics in the 12 months, showing that the proportion of Canadians reporting antibiotic use has declined slightly since then. Figure 6. Antibiotic use among Canadians (18+) Table 6. Antibiotic use among Canadians (18+) Figure 6: Text description Antibiotic use frequency Percentage of respondants Antibiotic Knowledge and Attitudes Misinformation about antibiotics is common. More than 1 in 4 people mistakenly believe antibiotics are effective against colds, flus, and viruses. Antimicrobial Use in Humans Human Antimicrobial Use is Decreasing Between 2017 and 2021, a decrease in antimicrobial consumption of 26.9% was observed in all Canadian jurisdictions, most pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic (2019 to 2021).

Percentage of antibiotics prescribed stratified by AWaRe classification, 2021. Figure 8: Text description AWaRe classification Percentage What is AWaRe? Access antibiotics are used for a wide range of common infectious diseases and show lower resistance potential than antibiotics in other groups. Watch antibiotics are recommended only for specific bacterial infections due to their higher resistance potential. Reserve antibiotics are recommended as a last resort, the use of which needs to be monitored and tailored to specific patients and settings, when all alternatives have failed or are not suitable. Inappropriate Prescribing is Common. Data from the National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (NAPS) suggest that 22.5% of prescriptions were deemed inappropriate in participating Canadian hospitals.

Last updated: 2023-11-18 The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing concern for global health and is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the top ten public health threats. The unnecessary use and overuse of antimicrobials is a primary driver of the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms (AROs). Canadians aged 80+ Per capita, Canadians aged 80 years or more received the highest number of prescriptions in 2022. 21+ Million prescriptions 21.4 million antimicrobial prescriptions were dispensed by retail pharmacies in 2022. AWaRe Access In 2022, 75% of antibiotics consumed in the community were WHO's AWaRe Access, surpassing WHO's benchmark. This interactive tool demonstrates the quantity of antimicrobial doses dispensed by Canadian retail pharmacies for a rolling 72 months. It provides a summary of antimicrobial consumption by antimicrobial class or AWaRe category using the last 12 months of data. The AWaRe categories are Access, Watch and Reserve. The WHO created this classification system to account for the impact of different antibiotics on antimicrobial resistance and to emphasize the importance of their appropriate use. These quantities are expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1,000 census inhabitants or prescriptions per 1,000 census inhabitants. A DDD refers to the assumed average maintenance dose per day in adults. Heatmap of antimicrobial consumption by antimicrobial class AWaRe category (Updated: Octobber 23, 2023) How to use the heatmap Hovering over a cell reveals the number of DDDs or prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants for the selected antimicrobial category and corresponding province or region. This will also bring up a figure below visualizing antimicrobial consumption for the last 72 months for the same selection. Clicking on a cell will lock the selected value and corresponding visualization allowing for quick comparisons. To unlock the heatmap, simply click the previously selected cell.

Asthma in Canada Published: (2018-05-01) Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases in Canada. It affects Canadians of all ages, but younger Canadians are disproportionately affected. Symptoms of asthma include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. There is currently no cure for asthma; however, it can be well controlled by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, avoiding allergens and other triggers, quitting smoking, and taking medication properly. [PHAC Fact Sheet 2015] The Public Health Agency of Canada works with all provinces and territories, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System, to collect and report national surveillance data on asthma. A new publication, titled Report from the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System: Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Canada, 2018, describes the burden of chronic respiratory diseases in Canada. Some of the report's highlights are presented in this blog. 3.8 million The number of Canadians living with diagnosed asthma reached 3.8 million (10.8%) in 2011/12. Approximately 820,000 people sought medical attention due to their asthma during the same year. [PHAC CCDSS 2018] 67% The proportion of Canadians living with diagnosed asthma increased by 67% between 2000/01 and 2011/12; from 2.1 million (6.5%) in 2000/01 to 3.8 million (10.8%) in 2011/12. On a positive note, the proportion of Canadians who needed medical attention due to their asthma declined by 18% during the same time period, from 908,000 (2.8%) in 2000/01 to 820,000 (2.3%) in 2011/12. [PHAC CCDSS 2018] Children vs. Adults Asthma disproportionately affects children and youth. In 2011/12, the proportion of children and youth living with diagnosed asthma was on average 62% greater than the proportion of adults (including seniors) diagnosed with the disease.

Men vs. Women During childhood and teenage years, asthma is more common among boys than among girls (18% vs. 13%). In adulthood however, a greater proportion of women are affected by the disease than men (11% vs. 8%). [PHAC CDIIF 2016] Would you like to see age-group specific estimates for males and females?

That averages out to 443 newly diagnosed Canadians per day\u00e2\u0080\u0094or close to 3,100 every week!\u00e2\u0080\u0094during that year. [PHAC CCDSS 2018] Geographic Differences The proportion of Canadians living with asthma varies geographically; in 2011/12, the provincial and territorial proportions ranged from 3.8% to 12.1%.

Autism Spectrum Disorder in CanadaPublished: (2018-04-03) Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes impairments in language, communication skills, and social interactions combined with restricted and repetitive behaviours, interests or activities.Footnote 1 Each person with ASD is unique and will have different symptoms, deficits and abilities. Because of the range of characteristics, this condition is named a \u00e2\u0080\u009cspectrum\u00e2\u0080\u009d disorder, where ones\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abilities and deficits can fall anywhere along a spectrum, and thereby, support needs may range from none to very substantial. It is a complex life-long condition that impacts not only the person with ASD, but their families, caregivers and communities. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is working closely with provincial and territorial (P/T) partners on the National Autism Spectrum Disorder Surveillance System (NASS). The NASS provides national data on the number (i.e., prevalence) of children and youth ages 5-17 years living with ASD. Initial results have been published in the 2018 NASS report. Findings are based on data collected from Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory and represent a total of 40% of all children and youth aged 5\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years across Canada. Some of the key findings are summarized below. 1 in 66 1 in 66 children and youth (i.e., 15.2 per 1,000) 5\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years of age were diagnosed with ASD in 2015. The number of children and youth with ASD varied between provinces and territories from 1 in 126 to 1 in 57.Footnote 2 Boys vs Girls Signs of ASD are usually detected in early childhood. Males were identified with ASD four times more frequently at 1 in 42 (i.e., 23.9 per 1,000) than females at 1 in 165 (i.e., 6.0 per 1,000).Footnote 2 6 years Among those diagnosed by 17 years of age, 56% had received their diagnosis by 6 years of age; almost three-quarters (i.e., 72%) had been diagnosed by 8 years of age; and less than 10% were diagnosed after 12 years of age.Footnote 2 Canada and United States comparison The United States (U.S.) and Canada use different methods to estimate the prevalence of autism. In the U.S., data on 8 year old children with autism are captured in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. In 2012, the most recent year for which data are reported, records from multiple sources were reviewed from 11 different network sites. Records were reviewed by a healthcare professional to determine if a child has a diagnosis of ASD and/or behaviours consistent with ASD. Despite the differences in methods between Canada and the U.S., the results from these two tracking systems are quite similar with the prevalence of ASD among 8 year olds being 1 in 63 in Canada (2015) and 1 in 68 in the US (2012).

Big Picture Mortality in Canada Published: (2018-05-04) Every year more than 250,000 Canadians die of various causes. Each death becomes part of a vital statistics mortality dataset. Death data in Canada is categorized using a classification system entitled International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision, commonly known as ICD-10. The ICD-10 classification system categorizes cause of death data into 22 groups referred to as chapters. Each chapter contains numerous sub-groups. A series of letters and numbers designates each chapter as part of the classification scheme (see links below to the ICD-10 classification system). For example, if the primary cause of death is cancer of the body of the stomach, it would be recorded as a cancer death in Chapter 2, Neoplasms and receive a code of C16.2. The interactive diagram below shows the number and proportion of Canadians in 2015, by age group, that died from causes in each of the various chapters. Three chapters had no deaths and were excluded below. It is important to note that every death captured in the data below has been attributed to one underlying cause - the immediate cause of death. However, in the majority of cases, several conditions or diseases are involved. For example, diabetes can contribute to a death attributed to heart attack, and depression can contribute to a death related to suicide. In the future, multiple-cause-of death data will allow us to explore the broader factors involved in mortality.

Annually, throughout spring, cities across Canada hold a Bike to Work Week or Day. For everyone who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to dust off their bikes this spring, we want to tell you about BikeMaps.org - use it to plan your routes and avoid traffic, in order to stay safe and improve your health! But first, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the numbers: Modes of Transportation According to the 2011 census, of 15.4 million workers travelling to and from their place of work, approximately: 12.3 million people drive 1.9 million use public transportation 900 000 walk 200 000 bike [2011 Census] 22.2% Biking to work is a great way to reach the recommended amount of physical activity (150 minutes a week). Right now, only 22.2% of Canadians are reaching it. [Physical Activity Guidelines] 44.4% Having a workplace that facilitates active transportation is important. For example, 44.4% of Canadian adults say they have access to a shower in their workplaces. Having access to showers and change rooms is a supportive resource for those wanting to bike to work or engage in lunch-time physical activity. [Physical Activity Guidelines] 15 min x 2 Did you know that it only takes a 15 minute bike ride twice a day, five days a week to meet your weekly amount of active time? Even if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bike every day, using active transportation can be a solid foundation for getting your weekly physical activity. Make better use of the time that you would have otherwise spent in traffic! [Physical Activity Guidelines] What is BikeMaps.org? Recently, the Public Health Agency of Canada funded the Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF) to expand BikeMaps.org: A citizen web-mapping surveillance tool for safe and accessible bicycling and healthy living promotion. BikeMaps.org is an interactive mapping tool used by riders in different cities around Canada and the world. Riders can record places around their city where there have been collisions or where they feel other riders should be cautious (near-misses). It lets you plan your route to avoid dangerous areas. As May is Bike to Work month, safety is top of mind. Apps like the one produced by BikeMaps.org are extremely useful to keep all riders safe. Better yet, the data can be used to inform urban planning! What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Going on?

Knowledge of BIA-ALCL continues to evolve. For more information on BIA-ALCL, please visit Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Breast Implant Risks page. Subscribe to get breast implant updates Understanding the Data Blog This data is intended to inform Canadians of the number of cases of BIA-ALCL that have been reported to Health Canada. This data cannot be used to determine an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk of developing BIA-ALCL. Since each person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health status and personal circumstances are different, concerns regarding BIA-ALCL should be discussed with a health care provider. Canadian BIA-ALCL Surveillance Given the growing number of cases globally, Canadian BIA-ALCL Surveillance is designed to monitor confirmed and suspected cases of BIA-ALCL within Canada. Cases of BIA-ALCL can be reported directly to Health Canada through the Consumer Medical Device Report Form by individuals and/or their health care providers. Cases are also reported by the breast implant manufacturer and importer, and by hospitals, who have reporting obligations. Therefore, reports are received from manufacturers and importers, health care providers, hospitals, and individuals. These reports are reviewed by Health Canada to identify duplicate reports and to classify cases using the criteria outlined below. Surveillance will remain in place until there is a downward trend in BIA-ALCL cases in Canada following a minimum of nine (9) years of surveillance. Canadian BIA-ALCL Surveillance will continue until at least 2030. The data presented here will be updated annually. Case Identification Confirmed Case* Individuals that had or currently have breast implants, AND Confirmation of BIA-ALCL biomarkers, and/or A report from a health care provider indicating a BIA-ALCL diagnosis or treatment * Pathology results are needed to properly diagnose BIA-ALCL. In recognition of the well established diagnostic criteria, if a case is submitted by a physician indicating a diagnosis of, or treatment for BIA-ALCL, proof of pathology results are not required to be included as a confirmed case. Suspected Case Individuals that had or currently have breast implants, AND Partial biomarkers for BIA-ALCL, and/or Indication from a health care provider that it is a suspected case of BIA-ALCL Exclusions Tertiary reports submitted to Health Canada from social media, news articles, journals articles, etc. Canadian BIA-ALCL Surveillance Estimates as of 2022 Based on the data available, it is estimated that there are currently 69 confirmed and 27 suspected cases of BIA-ALCL in Canada.

On this page About the program Number of tests: February 22, 2021 to September 30, 2022 Percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive, by mode of travel: February 22, 2021 to July 4, 2021 Percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive, by vaccination status and mode of travel: July 5, 2021 to September 30, 2022 About the program The Canada Border Testing Program (CBTP) was in place from February 22, 2021 to September 30, 2022. During this time, international travellers entering Canada at air or land borders had to meet various COVID-19 testing requirements. The number and types of tests required depended on the requirements in place at the time. The CBTP test result data includes arrival and post-entry test results. You can use this dashboard to track and compare the percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive among international travellers entering Canada. Refer to the Timeline for the entry rules and testing requirements in place at different times throughout the program. Refer to Definitions for detailed explanations of some of the terms used on this page. Number of tests: February 22, 2021 to September 30, 2022 5,808,014 Total tests 130,935 Total positive tests About the number of tests Total tests is the number of arrival and post-entry tests taken by international travellers as part of the CBTP. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the same as the total number of travellers tested, because some travellers were tested more than once. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also different from the total number of conclusive (positive or negative) test results. Total positive test results is the number of positive arrival and post-entry test results among international travellers tested as part of the CBTP. This is different from the number of international travellers who tested positive as part of the CBTP, as some travellers tested positive on more than one occasion. For the percentage of COVID-19 test results that were positive over time, please refer to Figures 1 and 2. Percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive, by mode of travel: February 22 to July 4, 2021 1,212,511 arrival and post-entry tests were completed by international travellers entering Canada between February 22 and July 4, 2021. During this time, the Government of Canada didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have separate testing requirements for partially/unvaccinated and fully vaccinated travellers and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t collect information on the vaccination status of travellers.

This is due to changes to the CBTP that came into effect on July 5, 2021. Notes From February 22 to July 4, 2021, all travellers, regardless of vaccination status, had to take: a pre-entry test (this data not included in Figure 1) an arrival test, and a post-entry test, on either Day-10 (February 22 to April 22, 2021) or Day-8 (April 23 to July 4, 2021) of their mandatory quarantine. The week of entry is based on the date the traveller entered Canada. These are grouped into 7-day periods (Sunday to Saturday), except for the week of June 27 to July 4, 2021 (see above). The weekly percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive is the number of positive arrival and post-entry test results for that week divided by the sum of the number of positive plus the number of negative arrival and post-entry test results for that same week. The result is then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive, by vaccination status and mode of travel: July 5, 2021 to September 30, 2022 4,595,503 arrival and post-entry tests were completed by international travellers entering Canada between July 5, 2021 and September 30, 2022. During this time, there were different testing requirements for partially/unvaccinated and fully vaccinated travellers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep these differences in mind when comparing trends over time between partially/unvaccinated and fully vaccinated travellers.

Notes The CBTP ended on September 30, 2022. Labs were required to send all available border test results to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) by end of day on September 30, 2022. However, some samples collected during the weeks leading up to September 30 may not have been processed by labs in time to meet this deadline. Test positivity for the final 2 weeks of September should be interpreted with this understanding. Each shaded box represents a distinct phase, or time period. We retroactively defined these phases to capture key changes to border testing requirements over time, particularly where these may have had an impact on test positivity. See the Timeline for the testing requirements in place during each phase of the CBTP. The week of entry is based on the date the traveller entered Canada. Weeks are grouped into 7-day periods (Sunday to Saturday), unless otherwise indicated with an asterisk (*). The weekly percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive is the number of positive arrival and post-entry test results for that week divided by the sum of the number of positive plus the number of negative arrival and post-entry test results for that same week. The result is then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Partially/unvaccinated travellers From July 5, 2021 to September 30, 2022, the data include arrival and post-entry (Day-8) test results from all partially/unvaccinated travellers required to take both tests. From February 28 to September 30, 2022, the data also include arrival test results from partially/unvaccinated children aged 5 to 11 travelling with a fully vaccinated adult. These children only had to complete an arrival test if randomly selected for testing. Fully vaccinated travellers From July 5, 2021 to June 10, 2022, the data include arrival test results from all fully vaccinated travellers, whether or not they were enrolled in mandatory random testing (MRT). From June 11 to September 30, 2022, the data only include arrival test results from fully vaccinated travellers who were enrolled in MRT. From June 11 to July 18, 2022, MRT was temporarily paused for fully vaccinated travellers arriving by air. As a result, Figure 2 contains a line break from June 11 to July 18, 2022, for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAir\u00e2\u0080\u009d mode of travel. MRT continued at the land border during this time.

Published: (2020-09-21) Canada is covered with 347 million hectares of forest, making up 9% of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total forest area. With so many forested areas, wildfires are a serious risk for Canadians, particularly from May to September. Large, destructive fires can quickly spread out of control. They occur most commonly in British Columbia, the Prairies, and parts of Ontario and Quebec. The smoke produced from such wildfires significantly affects air quality, which can increase several health risks. Wildfire smoke contains small particles from burned material, such as wood and plants, and harmful gases. Winds can carry the harmful smoke far past the initial wildfire, affecting communities thousands of kilometers away. Assessing wildfire impact The Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool (AQBAT) is a computer application developed by scientists at Health Canada and used to estimate the health impacts caused by changes in outdoor air quality. Epidemiologist Dr. Dave Stieb and other scientists use AQBAT to examine the human health impacts of actions proposed to reduce outdoor air pollution and to estimate the health burden associated with air pollution. AQBAT uses population, health outcome and pollutant concentration data to predict the health impacts to Canadians from changes in outdoor air quality, including wildfires. Collaborators from Environment and Climate Change Canada use a model called FireWork to estimate the impact of wildfires on air quality, which is then loaded into AQBAT to estimate the mortality rate and other health impacts specifically caused by wildfire smoke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy using these predictive tools, we can take proactive steps to reduce the risks of mortality and other health impacts caused by wildfire smoke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Stieb. He and Dr. Carlyn Matz are authors of a health impact analysis of wildfire smoke in Canada. Hundreds of thousands of people per year experience adverse health impacts, and some may even die, due to wildfire smoke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnderstanding the health impacts of wildfires is important as climate change is expected to increase wildfire frequency and season length,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Matz. Description This map shows the mortality rate attributed to wildfire smoke in Canada in 2018. British Columbia was affected the most by fires that year. However, AQBAT analysis indicates the impacts also extended into Alberta, as well as Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories.The mortality rate (per 100,000) attributed to wildfire smoke in the Ottawa census district in 2018 was 0.04. Download the data (.csv) Staying safe under fire Wildfire smoke and its subsequent effects on outdoor air quality pose several health risks. The harmful particles and gases in the smoke cause respiratory problems when inhaled. Those with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma are especially at risk, as the smoke can worsen these conditions. Symptoms of smoke inhalation include congestion, headaches, watery or irritated eyes, coughing, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. While those closest to the fire are at a higher risk than those farther away, smoke can still travel thousands of kilometres with the wind and have impacts far from the source. There are many ways to protect yourself and others during wildfires. Prepare for wildfire season by ensuring you have enough medication for any health conditions. It is important to stay informed about wildfires by listening to the news or to local authorities. If an evacuation becomes necessary, be prepared with a plan and follow the instructions of authorities. If an evacuation isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessary, you can also take steps to stay safe in your home. If possible, filter the air in your home using an air conditioner or a HEPA filter. You should avoid going outdoors during smoke events or when the outdoor air quality is poor. Consider going to a location with cleaner air, such as a shopping mall or library. If you must go outside, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool Providing valuable information about wildfire smoke is just one example of what the AQBAT can do to keep Canadians informed and healthy. AQBAT is the go-to application used to predict the benefits (positive impacts) or damages (negative impacts) of proposed outdoor air quality regulations, and is the key tool for examining the impacts of outdoor air pollution in Canada.Find out more about AQBAT and air quality research.

It presents data about breastfeeding in Canada, including related factors such as age, education and immigration status. The data is from the 2017-2018 Canadian Community Health Survey. It reflects information gathered from survey respondents who were between the ages of 15 and 55, identified as female, and had given birth in the previous 5 years. On this page Overview Key findings Breastfeeding newborns Stopping breastfeeding Breastfeeding exclusively Vitamin D supplements Overview Breastfeeding is important for the short-term and long-term health of babies, young children and parents. Experts recommendFootnote 1 that babies be fed: breast milk only (\u00e2\u0080\u0098exclusive breastfeeding\u00e2\u0080\u0099) for the first 6 months of life breast milk for 2 years or longer, along with other age-appropriate foods beginning at 6 months Global breastfeeding targets aim to increase the rate of 6-month exclusive breastfeeding to at least 50% by 2025, and to 70% by 2030Footnote 2Footnote 3. Key findings in Canada 91% of parents started out breastfeeding 62% of parents who breastfed did so for at least 6 months 35% of parents who breastfed exclusively did so for at least 6 months 88% of breastfed babies received vitamin D supplements Technical note about confidence intervals The data tables below each graphic include confidence intervals (CIs), which are statistical measures of how precise the estimates are. The confidence interval provides a range of values that the true estimate would be expected to fall between, a certain percentage of the time, if the data was re-sampled in the same way. The narrower the range of the confidence interval, the more precise the estimate. All of the displayed confidence intervals are 95% probability. Breastfeeding parents Most parents in Canada start out breastfeeding. The map shows the breastfeeding rates in each province and territory. Figure 1.

Instructions for using the dashboard Select a chemical biomarker from the dropdown menu at the top of the Results page. Click the dropdown menu to show the list of available biomarkers and begin typing to search the list. Click on a biomarker from the list or press enter to select it. Click the plus sign icon for advanced search options. Use these options to filter the list of available biomarkers by chemical group, chemical name or Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CAS RN). Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve selected a biomarker, figures are automatically generated. They show the levels (also known as concentrations) of that biomarker in the Canadian population by collection period. The first figure shows the level for the total Canadian population, the second figure shows the level by age group, and the third figure shows the level by sex. These figures show geometric means for all available collection periods for that biomarker. Use the dropdown menus to display specific collection periods or to select another matrix, unit or statistic (such as the 50th or 95th percentile). The matrix is the medium in which a biomarker is measured, such as blood, urine or hair. Some biomarkers are measured in more than one matrix. The unit of measurement may change depending on the matrix you select. Figures first appear in colours that colour blind users can access. Click the paint brush icon to change the figure colour scheme to shades of blue or grey. Click the refresh icon to reset the dashboard. A data table is displayed below the figures. It shows the data in each figure, as well as extra information such as the number of samples and the detection frequency. In some cases, figures are not generated for a selected biomarker. This is due to insufficient data. In these cases, the following message will appear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cResults are not available (NA), not calculated (NC), below the limit of detection (<LOD), or suppressed (F or X) for this chemical biomarker. See the data table below for more information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other cases, figures are generated when a biomarker is selected but some results (bars or circles) are missing. In these cases, the following note will accompany the figures: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne or more results are not shown. See the data table below for more information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Interpreting the results Exercise caution when comparing biomonitoring results across collection periods. Because the age ranges sampled and the LOD can change over time, you should review this information in the data table before making conclusions. In specific cases, such as for cadmium and triclosan measured in urine, the analytical method used to measure chemicals has changed over time. Results for cadmium and triclosan in urine should not be directly compared across collection periods. Use caution when comparing creatinine-adjusted results for chemical biomarkers measured in urine. Creatinine levels differ by age and sex. We recommend that you only compare creatinine-adjusted levels for the same age group or sex across collection periods. Do not compare creatinine-adjusted levels across age groups or between sexes. For more information on considerations for interpreting the biomonitoring data, please see the Sixth Report on Human Biomonitoring of Environmental Chemicals in Canada. Human biomonitoring Human biomonitoring is the measurement of environmental chemicals in body fluids or tissues. This includes the parent compounds or their breakdown products, also known as metabolites. An environmental chemical is a chemical substance, either human-made or natural, that is present in the environment and which humans may be exposed to through air, water, food, soil, dust or consumer products. The primary purpose of human biomonitoring is to estimate chemical exposure levels within a population. This information helps scientists, health professionals and policy makers evaluate exposures and develop policies to protect the health of people in Canada. Data from multiple collection periods can be used to track changes over time and assess the effectiveness of risk management actions. For new chemicals, national data are an important baseline, or starting point, for future monitoring and research. Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) National human biomonitoring data come from the CHMS. The CHMS is an ongoing national survey led by Statistics Canada, in partnership with Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. The CHMS is Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most comprehensive, direct health measures survey, and is designed to represent the Canadian population. Through personal interviews and the collection of physical measurements and biological samples, the survey provides data on indicators of: environmental exposures chronic and infectious diseases fitness nutritional status other factors The human biomonitoring component of the CHMS measures environmental chemicals in blood or urine. Data are collected in 2-year collection periods (also known as cycles). Chemicals were selected for inclusion in the survey based on one or more of several considerations, including: known or suspected health effects level of public concern evidence of chemical exposure in the Canadian population new or existing requirements for public health action ability to detect and measure the chemical or its breakdown products in people similarity to chemicals monitored in other national and international programs known data gaps costs of performing the analysis Chemicals can be rotated in or out of different collection periods. In some cases, chemicals have been measured in multiple collection periods to track changes over time or obtain a larger number of samples necessary for data analysis. In other cases, chemicals were removed and may be added back in later collection periods. Suggested citation Health Canada. 2023. Canadian Biomonitoring Dashboard. Ottawa, ON.

Information on 24 different categories of cancer types, including overall cancer, are available. The Public Health Agency of Canada developed this tool using Statistic Canada\u2019s Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR) and Canadian Vital Statistics Death (CVSD) database. Data for the CCR and CVSD databases are obtained from provincial and territorial cancer and vital statistics registries. Through standardized reporting methods, these data allow for more nationally comparable estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Canada."

The system collects data on all residents who are eligible for provincial or territorial health insurance. It can generate national estimates and trends over time for over 20 chronic diseases and conditions, and other selected health outcomes. To identify people with chronic diseases and conditions, provincial and territorial health insurance registry records are linked using a unique personal identifier to the corresponding physician billing claims, hospital discharge abstract records and prescription drug records.Key information about the CCDSS methods and case definitions is presented below.

2021\u20132022 Data proceduresThe following data procedures are applied on the data submitted by the provinces and territories. Age group aggregation for age-specific estimations or ratesThe data submitted by provinces and territories by five-year age groups are aggregated using the following life course age groups: 1-19, 20-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65-79 and 80+ with a few exceptions. The data by five-year age groups are reported at the national level only.ConfidentialityTwo different procedures are used to ensure data confidentiality and avoid residual disclosure:Data suppressionThe estimates, rates, and rate ratios are not reported when the corresponding unrounded counts are less than 10. Note that all provincial/territorial unrounded counts, whether suppressed or not, are part of the total counts used to produce Canadian estimates, rates and rate ratios.Random roundingAll provincial/territorial and Canadian counts 10 or greater are randomly rounded either up or down to an adjacent multiple of 5. Canadian counts are obtained by summing provincial/territorial counts prior to random rounding. Random rounding is only used to calculate crude estimates/rates. Age-standardized estimates/rates are based on unrounded counts.Data qualityThe estimates, rates and rate ratios with a coefficient of variation exceeding 33.3% are suppressed to ensure that the provincial/territorial data are of acceptable quality.Rate calculationSee CCDSS summary of methods.Age standardizationThe estimates or rates are age-standardized to the 2011 Canada population, using unrounded counts and five-year age groups, to adjust for differences in population age structure. Provincial and territorial notesMore disease/condition-specific notes, including provincial/territorial specifications, are included in the CCDSS case definitions documentation. Manitoba: Mortality data for 2021\u20132022 are excluded.New Brunswick: Data for 2021\u20132022 are not available.Newfoundland and Labrador: Data before 2008\u20132009 are excluded.Northwest Territories: Only hospital data are included. Data are only available for acute myocardial infarction, hospitalized stroke and hip fracture.Nunavut: Data before 2005\u20132006 are excluded.Quebec: Data cells with counts smaller than 5 were suppressed by Quebec and substituted with random numbers (1-4) by PHAC. As a result, age-specific incidence and mortality rates may be randomly over or under estimated.The modernization of the billing system for fee-for-service medical services by the R\u00e9gie de l'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (RAMQ) in 2016 has resulted in a decrease in the entry of diagnostic codes in the fee-for-service medical services file. Data for 2016\u20132017 and subsequent years should therefore be interpreted with caution, as a slight underestimation is suspected.Saskatchewan: Data for 2021\u20132022 are not available.Yukon: Data before 2010\u20132011 are excluded. Note: For more information on the interpretation of the data for specific diseases/conditions please see the CCDSS case definitions documentation and the data tool notes. Guidance for data users on examining the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCDSS measuresFactors related to the COVID-19 pandemic including differences in healthcare seeking behaviour, the availability and use of healthcare services, as well as true changes in health status, may have impacted the CCDSS measures. As such, CCDSS estimates should be used cautiously when making inferences about population health during this period (see CCDSS COVID-19 guidance for data users).

The 2019-2020 version of this report has been archived. Summary Data tables Technical notes Summary Data tables Technical notes Health Canada monitors the prevalence of substance use and its impact on postsecondary students through the Canadian Postsecondary Education Alcohol and Drug Use Survey (CPADS). Governments and non-governmental organizations use this information to shape policies and programs that address substance use and support students. CPADS 2021-22 marks the survey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second cycle. To view results from the initial survey cycle, refer to CPADS 2019-20. About CPADS 2021-22 CPADS 2021-22 recruited postsecondary students who were studying online or in person at a Canadian university, college, or CEGEP and living in Canada. A total of 40,931 respondents of all ages and programs completed online surveys between November 29, 2021 and April 19, 2022 across all 10 provinces. The survey asks students about the following substances: Alcohol Cannabis Psychoactive pharmaceuticals (pain relievers, sedatives, and stimulants) Illegal drugs (such as heroin and cocaine) Tobacco and vaping products This report presents national and gender-specific results (women, men, transgender/non-binary). Where harms are known to differ based on sex-based physiological differences, results by sex (female, male) are reported instead of by gender. There are several differences between the first and second CPADS cycles. While CPADS 2019-20 included undergraduate students aged 17 to 25 attending classes in-person, the 2021-22 survey added students of all ages and in all programs, regardless of program delivery (i.e., online, in-person, and mixed delivery). To increase comparability between the two cycles, the 2021-22 results reported below pertain specifically to 17 to 25 year olds and comparisons to the 2019-20 cycle are made where relevant. CPADS 2021-22 is the first to examine substance use according to self-reported mental health. The Technical notes tab includes definition of terms, data suppression rules, and other information helpful to interpreting the data. All results are available in the Data Tables tab, reported by \u00e2\u0080\u009coverall\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The key findings below report differences between survey cycles or genders (\u00e2\u0080\u009cincreased\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecreased\u00e2\u0080\u009d) only when these are statistically significant with at least a small effect size1. For greater readability, the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cstatistically significant\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the effect size are not repeated. At times, the text states \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere were no meaningful differences\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though the numbers are not identical. This indicates the difference is not statistically significant and/or the effect size is so trivial as to have little or no influence on the variable being reported. About the students The findings below pertain specifically to respondents aged 17 to 25 years enrolled in any program at a university, college, or CEGEP \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a total of 31,643 students (from the 40,931 total survey responses) who self-identified as women (61%), men (35%) and transgender/non-binary (4%). With regard to campus attendance, 30% of these students studied in-person, 21% online, and 48% reported a mix of in-person and online. Results Alcohol Figure 1. Past 12 month alcohol consumption 2. Past 30 day alcohol consumption 3. Frequency of alcohol consumption in the past 30 days 4. Heavy drinking in the past 30 days 5. Past 30 day alcohol use by beverage type 6. Alcohol related harms due to own drinking in the past 30 days [among past 12 month drinkers] 7. Alcohol harms due to others drinking in the past 30 days 8. Alcohol protective behaviours \"usually\" or \"always\" used in the past 30 days [among past 12 month drinkers] In the past 12 months, 79% of students drank alcohol. Drinking in the past 12 months was similar across gender groups. Figure 1: Text Description 1 Females were significantly more likely than males to have consumed alcohol in the past 12 months. 2 Students in third year or higher were significantly more likely than students in 1st or 2nd year to have consumed alcohol in the past 12 months. Key alcohol findings: Postsecondary students reported consuming alcohol more than any other substance. Nearly half of all students reported heavy drinking, while 1 in 6 were aware of drinking guidelines. Compared to CPADS 2019-20, alcohol-related harms decreased among postsecondary students, as did alcohol consumption. Since the onset of COVID-19, approximately one third of students reported the quantity and frequency of their alcohol consumption decreased, most often due to fewer social gatherings. Among the approximately one third who reported drinking more since the onset of COVID-19, the top reason was boredom. Detailed alcohol findings Eighty-five percent (85%) of students had consumed alcohol in their lifetime; 79% had consumed alcohol in the past 12 months, while 64% had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days (decreased from 74% in 2019-20). There were no meaningful differences by gender. Among all students, 30% reported drinking once per week or more often in the past 30 days (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Among all students, 1 in 6 (17%) had heard of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2011 Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelinesi (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Students were asked about the 2011 Guidelines specifically, as these were the ones in place while data was being collected. Among students who drank in the past 30 days, the most common alcoholic beverages consumed were spirits and liquors (63%), followed by wine (57%) and beer (51%). Forty-five percent (45%) of all students had consumed alcohol in a pattern consistent with heavy drinking in the past 30 days (decreased from 57% in 2019-20). When analyzed by sex, there were no meaningful differences. Sixty-four percent (64%) of students who drank in the past 30 days reported feeling drunk at least once over this period (decreased from 74% in 2019-20). When analyzed by gender, there were no meaningful differences. Among those who drank alcohol in the past 30 days, men were more likely to report feeling drunk once a week or more (at 23%), compared to women (15%) and individuals identifying as transgender/non-binary (15%). Among students who drank alcohol within the past 12 months, 47% experienced at least 1 alcohol-related harm in the past month (decreased from 56% in 2019-20). When analyzed by gender, there were no meaningful differences. Students reported most often that they experienced a hangover (27%), had less energy or felt tired (20%), drank on nights when they planned not to (17%), said or did something embarrassing (16%), or felt sick to their stomach or threw up (14%). Respondents could select more than 1 harm. Seventeen percent (17%) of all students reported experiencing at least 1 harm within the past month because of another student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking (decreased from 31% in 2019-20). When analyzed by gender, there were no meaningful differences. The secondary harms most often reported were the need to take care of another student (7%), that their sleep was affected (7%), another student upset or disappointed them (6%), that their studies were interrupted (4%) and that another student caused an argument with them (3%). Almost all students (97%) who consumed alcohol in the past 30 days employed protective strategies \u00e2\u0080\u009calways\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cusually\u00e2\u0080\u009d to slow down alcohol consumption, avoid intoxication, and prevent dangerous alcohol-related consequences (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Among those who drank in the past 12 months, 11% reported driving within 2 hours of consuming at least 2 drinks (no meaningful difference between cycles). Men (at 15%) were more likely to drive within 2 hours of consuming drinks than women (8%). Fifteen percent (15%) of students reported ever being a passenger with a driver who had recently consumed alcohol. Among those who drank in the past 12 months, 40% reported the quantity of alcohol they consumed remained the same since the COVID-19 pandemic, while 30% reported they consumed less alcohol and 30% reported consuming more. Similarly, 37% of students reported consuming alcohol at the same frequency, while 34% consumed less frequently and 28% more frequently. The top reasons reported for more alcohol consumption during COVID-19 were boredom (47%), more social gatherings online or at home (43%), lack of a regular schedule (39%), depression/low mood (33%) and stress (32%). The top reasons reported for drinking less alcohol were fewer social gatherings online or at home (79%), trying to save money (16%), living at home with parents (14%), depression/low mood (9%) and lack of a regular schedule (9%). Cannabis Figure 9. Past 12 month cannabis use 10. Past 30 day cannabis use 11. Frequency of cannabis consumption in the past 30 days 12. Cannabis products used in the past 12 months [among past 12 month users] Within the past 12 months, 43% of all respondents had used cannabis. Past year use of cannabis was greater among transgender/non-binary respondents (55% vs. 43% among women and 42% among men). Figure 9: Text Description 1 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than men to have used cannabis in the past 12 months. 2 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than women to have used cannabis in the past 12 months. Key cannabis findings: Overall, prevalence and frequency of cannabis consumption did not meaningfully change among postsecondary students compared to CPADS 2019-20. Cannabis use was notably higher among transgender/non-binary students compared to men and women. In terms of sourcing cannabis, there was a notable increase in the number of students reporting they obtained it from a legal storefront. As for cannabis products of choice, edibles remained the most common type (no notable change between cycles), while use of dried flower/leaf decreased and use of vaping pens and cannabis beverages increased. Among students who used cannabis in the previous 12 months, nearly half reported an increase in both the quantity and frequency of use since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the top reason being boredom. At the same time, there was a notable decrease in students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 awareness of educational campaigns or public health messaging related to cannabis health risks. Detailed cannabis findings In the past 12 months, 43% of students had used cannabis (no meaningful difference between cycles). Past 12-month cannabis use was higher among transgender/non-binary students (55%) than women (43%) and men (42%). Twenty-nine percent (29%) of students had used cannabis in the past 30 days (no meaningful difference between cycles). Past 30-day cannabis use was higher among transgender/non-binary students (42%) than women (29%) and men (29%). Eight percent (8%) of students consumed cannabis on a daily or almost daily basis (5 or more days per week), with no meaningful difference between cycles. Daily or almost daily use of cannabis in the past 30 days was higher among transgender/non-binary students (14%) than men (8%) and women (7%). Among students who had used cannabis in the past 12 months: The most common types of cannabis products used were edibles (62%; no meaningful difference between cycles), dried flower/leaf (60%; decreased from 74% in 2019-20), vape pens (50%; increased from 40% in 2019-20), cannabis oil for oral use (20%; no meaningful difference between cycles) and cannabis beverages (18%; increased from 3% in 2019-20). The top sources to obtain cannabis were from a legal storefront (63%; increased from 34% in 2019-20), from a friend (14%; decreased from 25% in 2019-20), shared among friends (8%; decreased from 14% in 2019-20) and from a legal online source (5%; no meaningful difference between cycles). Among students who had used cannabis in the past 12 months, 23% reported that they had driven within 2 hours of smoking or vaporizing cannabis (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Almost a third (29%) of all students reported being a passenger in a vehicle driven by someone who recently used cannabis (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Among those who reported using cannabis in the past 3 months, scores from the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST - see Key definitions) indicated that 31% were at low risk of health and other problems from their current pattern of use, while 62% were at moderate risk. Eight percent (8%) were at high risk of experiencing severe problems, and likely to have a substance dependence (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Students were asked if they had seen or heard education campaigns or public health or safety messages about cannabis in various locations since the Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018. Twenty-one percent (21%) reported that they had not noticed any such campaigns or messages (increased from 7% in 2019-20; no meaningful difference by gender). The most common locations for students to have seen or heard these messages were on social media (58%), at school (41%), publicly displayed posters or billboards (32%), and TV/radio (32%). Among students who consumed cannabis in the past 12 months, 79% reported using it in combination with another substance, most commonly with alcohol (75%; no meaningful difference between cycles or by gender), followed by tobacco or an e-cigarette with nicotine (23%; decreased from 42% in 2019-20). Men (28%) reported using cannabis in combination with tobacco or an e-cigarette with nicotine more than women (18%), though there were no meaningful differences between transgender/non-binary students (at 22%) and men or women. Among those who had used cannabis in the past 12 months, 47% reported the quantity they consumed had increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, while 34% reported consuming the same amount, and 18% reported consuming less. Similarly, 46% of students reported consuming cannabis more frequently, while 34% consumed at the same frequency and 20% consumed less. The top reasons reported for more cannabis consumption during COVID-19 were boredom (63%), stress (48%), anxiety (48%), depression/low mood (46%), and lack of a regular schedule (43%). The top reasons reported for consuming less cannabis were fewer social gatherings online or at home (44%), anxiety (17%), living at home with parents (16%), trying to save money (13%), and depression/low mood (11%). Psychoactive pharmaceutical use Figure 13. Past 12 month use of psychoactive pharmaceuticals (pain relievers, stimulants, sedatives) 14. Higher-risk use\u00b9 of psychoactive pharmaceuticals among ever-users Overall, 37% of respondents used at least one opioid pain reliever, stimulant, or sedative in the past 12 months (increased from 36% in 2019-20). A quarter (25%) used pain relievers, 11% used stimulants and 10% used sedatives. Figure 13: Text Description All reported differences are statistically significant (p<=0.05) and have a meaningful effect size (h>=0.2). 1 Women were more likely than men to use all classes of pharmaceuticals in the past 12 months. 2 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than men to use all classes of pharmaceuticals in the past 12 months. 3 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than women to use stimulants and sedatives in the past 12 months. Key psychopharmaceutical findings: Overall, psychoactive pharmaceutical use among postsecondary students remains high with more than a third of students reporting use. Some of the reasons for use are unique to this population (for example, using stimulants to help cram for exams). Detailed psychopharmaceutical findings A quarter of students (25%) reported using opioid pain relievers in the past 12 months (no meaningful difference between cycles or by gender). Overall, 37% of students used at least 1 opioid pain reliever, stimulant, or sedative in the past 12 months (no meaningful difference between cycles). Transgender/non-binary students (52%) reported higher rates of psychoactive pharmaceutical use than women (41%) and men (32%). Among those who had ever used stimulants, 34% had used them in a higher-risk way in the past 12 months (decreased from 60% in 2019-20, no meaningful difference be gender). This was more than higher-risk use of opioid pain relievers (25%) and sedatives (15%). Among those who used pharmaceuticals in the past 12 months for reasons other than prescribed, the main reason for each pharmaceutical product was: to help them sleep (opioid pain relievers at 42%; no meaningful difference between cycles), to get high/for the feeling they caused (sedatives at 67%; no meaningful difference between cycles) and to cram for exams (stimulants at 45%; decreased from 56% in 2019-20). Women (50%) and transgender/non-binary students (44%) used opioid pain relievers to help them sleep more than men (32%). Transgender/non-binary students (78%) used sedatives to get high/for the feeling they caused more than men (70%) and women (64%). Men (47%) and women (45%) used stimulants to help them cram for exams more than transgender/non-binary students (16%). Illegal drug use Figure 15. Past 12 month use of illegal drugs Approximately 12% of participants reported using at least one illegal drug during the past 12 months (decreased from 15% in 2019-20). Use of illegal drugs was higher overall among transgender/non-binary students than among men and women. Figure 15: Text Description All reported differences are statistically significant (p<=0.05) and have a meaningful effect size (h>=0.2). * Moderate sampling variability, interpret with caution. # High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed. 1 Includes: Cocaine or crack, non-prescription amphetamines, methamphetamines, ecstasy or similar designer drugs, salvia, hallucinogens, sniffed glue, gasoline or other solvents, heroin, synthetic cannabinoids, mephedrone, BZP/TFMPP. 2 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than women to have used this drug in the past 12 months. Key illegal drug finding: Approximately 1 in 10 postsecondary students reported illegal drug use, most commonly \u00e2\u0080\u009cparty\u00e2\u0080\u009d drugs such as hallucinogens, cocaine, and ecstasy. Detailed illegal drug findings Students were asked if they had ever used or tried any of the following 11 illegal drugs: cocaine or crack; non-prescription amphetamines; methamphetamine; ecstasy or others similar designer/club drugs; hallucinogens; heroin; sniffed glue, gasoline or other solvents; salvia; synthetic cannabinoids; mephedrone; and BZP/TFMPP. Twelve percent (12%) reported using at least 1 of these substances in the past 12 months (no meaningful difference between cycles). By gender, more transgender/non-binary students (19%) reported illegal drug use than women (10%), though there were no meaningful differences between men (at 14%) and women or transgender/non-binary students. Among all students, the illegal drugs most reported to be used were hallucinogens (8%), cocaine (4%), and ecstasy or similar designer drugs (3%), with no meaningful differences between cycles. By gender, transgender/non-binary students (at 16%) reported using hallucinogens more than men (10%) and women (6%), with no meaningful differences in use of cocaine or ecstasy or similar designer drugs. Smoking and Vaping Figure 16. Current smoking status 17. Frequency of vaping and e-cigarette use in the past 30 days Nearly a quarter (23%) of students reported ever smoking at least a whole cigarette. In the past 30 days, 2% of all students reported smoking daily, while 92% reported not smoking at all. Figure 16: Text Description * Moderate sampling variability, interpret with caution. Key smoking and vaping finding: A minority of students reported daily use of cigarettes (at 2%) or vaping/e-cigarette products (8%). Detailed smoking and vaping findings Eight percent (8%) of all students reported any cigarette use in the past 30 days. Daily cigarette use during the past 30 days was reported by 2% of all students (cannot compare cycles; no meaningful differences by gender). In these findings, vaping includes both e-liquid with nicotine and without nicotine (just flavouring). E-cigarettes include all e-cigarettes, vape mods, vaporizers, and vape pens. Vaping cannabis is excluded. Seventeen percent (17%) of all students reported any vaping or e-cigarette use in the past 30 days. Daily vaping or e-cigarette use during the past 30 days was reported by 8% of students (cannot compare cycles; no meaningful differences by gender). Substance use and self-reported mental health Mental health was self-reported by students. Responses of \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcellent\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery good\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d are referred to collectively as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood mental health\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Responses of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor\u00e2\u0080\u009d are referred to collectively as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor mental health\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Key mental health findings: Almost half of students reported poor mental health, though this differed by gender. Students with poor mental health were more likely to consume cannabis, stimulants, and sedatives. In comparison to students with good mental health, those with poor mental health were more likely to have increased the amount of alcohol and cannabis they used since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Detailed mental health findings Overall, 45% of postsecondary students reported poor mental health. Transgender/non-binary students (77%) reported poor mental health more than women (50%) or men (36%). Students with poor mental health were more likely than those with good mental health to report past 12-month use of cannabis (52% vs. 36%), stimulants (15% vs. 8%), and sedatives (15% vs. 5%). Among both women and men, students with poor mental health were more likely to report past 12-month use of cannabis and sedatives. Among women, those with poor mental health were more likely to report use of stimulants than those with good mental health. Overall, students with poor mental health were more likely to report increasing the quantity of both alcohol (36%) and cannabis (55%) they consume since the onset of COVID-19 (March 2020) than those with good mental health (24% for alcohol and 38% for cannabis). Men and women with poor mental health were also more likely to have reported increased consumption of cannabis in combination with alcohol since the start of COVID-19 than those of the same gender with good mental health.

A new version of this report is available. \u00c3\u0097 Close overlay Supervised consumption sites (SCS) provide people who use drugs with a safe, non-judgemental environment, sterile consumption equipment, and services that include social, medical, and mental health care. The main goals of SCS are to help prevent overdose deaths, facilitate entry into addiction treatment programs, reduce the spread of bloodborne infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C), and reduce the strain on emergency medical services. For more information on supervised consumption sites, please visit Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supervised Consumption Sites and Services page. 4.3 million visits Canadian SCS saw around 4.3 million visits between 2017 and June 2023. Currently (September 2023), with 39 sites operating, it is estimated that around 2,700 visits take place every day. The busiest SCS in Canada see upwards of 400 visits each day. 49,000 overdoses and medical emergencies Canadian SCS attended to around 49,000 overdoses and drug-related medical emergencies between 2017 and June 2023, with no reported fatalities on-site. SCS staff also provide on-site harm reduction counselling to clients. At least 361,000 unique clients Based on the data available, it is estimated that at least 361,000 Canadians had sought services provided by SCS between 2017 and June 2023. Figure 1.

The use of methamphetamine, a stimulant drug that is not an opioid, was also prevalent among SCS clients. 257,000 referrals SCS connect receptive clients to substance use treatment and other health and social services that include medical care, mental health support, and/or housing services. Canadian SCS made around 257,000 referrals to such services between 2017 and June 2023. Acknowledgments These data were made possible through a collaboration between Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supervised consumption sites and Health Canada. Notes on the data Each SCS provides a standardized data report to Health Canada every month. Prior to March 2020, the data wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely standardized. Number of clients: The true number of unique clients visiting the sites between 2017 and June 2023 is difficult to estimate. Anonymous visits and inconsistent reporting by the sites make it difficult to derive a precise and accurate estimate. The number of unique clients is based on the number of different people using a site during the monthly reporting period. A person will only be counted once by a site each month, but the same person could be counted more than once when looking at data covering a period longer than one month. Number of referrals: The true number of referrals made by Canadian SCS between 2017 and June 2023 is difficult to estimate due to inconsistencies in how the sites defined and reported the number of referrals they made. In addition to SCS, there are numerous Urgent Public Health Need Sites (UPHNS)/Overdose Prevention Sites (OPS) operating across Canada. The numbers presented in this publication do not include data from UPHNS/OPS.

Cancer in Canada Published: (2018-01-22) Cancer is a disease that develops when abnormal cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, forming lumps or tumours that can invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) monitors national cancer trends using data from the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR). PHAC works closely with the Canadian Cancer Society, Statistics Canada, provinces and territories, and other partners to provide annual statistics to inform cancer prevention and control in Canada. Some of the latest findings: 565 per day Every day an average of 565 Canadians are diagnosed with cancer while 220 Canadians will die from it. [CCS 2017] 1 in 2 About 1 in 2 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime. [CCS 2017] Top 4 Fifty percent of all new cancer cases are one of the following: lung, breast, colorectal or prostate. [CCS 2017] 30% Cancer is responsible for 30% of all deaths in Canadians. [CCS 2017] 50+ Almost 90% of Canadians who develop cancer are 50 years or older. [CCS 2017] Men vs. Women In 2017, nearly equal number of men (103,100) and women (103,200) were diagnosed with cancer in Canada. [CCS 2017] 5-year survival rates The percentage of Canadians surviving at least five-years following their cancer diagnosis has improved over a 16 year period (1992-2008) from 53% to 60% for all cancers combined. [CCS 2017] Why 5 years? The 5-year survival rate is a measure that estimates the percentage of people alive 5 years after their cancer diagnosis, whether they are disease-free, in remission, or still having treatment. Many of these people will survive much longer\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially if the cancer is detected and treated early. For example, if the 5-year survival rate for a specific cancer is 90% it means that people who have that cancer are about 90% as likely to live for at least 5 years after diagnosis compared to people in the general population.

CYP-C collects information on children and youth with cancer including treatments, complications, and outcomes. CYP-C aims to help us to better understand risk factors, improve outcomes, enhance the quality and accessibility of care, and reduce late effects. The CYP-C surveillance system operates through a collaboration between the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, and the C17 Council, a network of all seventeen children's cancer hospitals across the country. Childhood cancer surveillance in Canada Each year, between 925 and 1,025 children under the age of fifteen are diagnosed with cancer in Canada. Over 86% of children survive a cancer diagnosis after five years, and this survival rate is expected to improve with new and better treatments. We monitor childhood cancer in Canada: To learn why children get cancer To understand the disease To inform policies and develop better treatments Get the latest data The Cancer in Young People in Canada Data Tool is updated regularly to provide pan-Canadian surveillance data on children and youth with cancer.

Key findings Data exploration Technical notes Key findings Data exploration Technical notes Data over the past 6 years The Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018 and provides legal, restricted access to cannabis and controls and regulates its production, distribution and sale. To help evaluate the impact of the legalization and regulation of cannabis, Health Canada has been conducting the annual Canadian Cannabis Survey (CCS) since 2018 to better understand how Canadians view and use cannabis. This data blog presents data from the past 6 years of the CCS. The 2018 cycle was conducted pre-legalization and the other 5 cycles were conducted post-legalization. To document changes over time, comparisons to 2018 are presented; in cases where a question was added after 2018, comparisons are made to the first year the question was asked. Findings are also compared to the previous survey cycle (2022)Footnote 1Footnote 2. Key findings on cannabis use for non-medical purposes from 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 are presented to examine self-reported changes since legalization and regulationFootnote 1Footnote 2. All results refer to cannabis use for non-medical purposes among Canadians aged 16 years and older. Cannabis use More than a quarter of Canadians reported cannabis use in the past 12 monthsFootnote 3 Past 12-month cannabis use in 2023 (26%) increased from 2018 (22%). Explore the data in Figure 2 Approximately 1 in 6 Canadians reported cannabis use in the past 30 daysFootnote 3 Past 30-day cannabis use increased from 15% in 2018 to 17% in 2023, and decreased from 19% in 2022 to 17% in 2023. In 2023, past 30-day use remained higher among males (19%, unchanged from 19% in 2018) than among females (15%, an increase from 11% in 2018). In 2023, past 30-day use remained higher among Canadians aged 16-19 years (29%, an increase from 23% in 2018) and 20-24 years (31%, unchanged from 30% in 2018) than among people age 25+ (15%, an increase from 13% in 2018). Frequency of daily or almost daily cannabis use remained unchanged Six percent (6%) of all Canadians reported using cannabis daily or almost daily, unchanged from 5% in 2018 and a decrease from 7% in 2022. This represented 23% of Canadians who reported using cannabis in the past 12 months, unchanged from 25% in both 2018 and 2022. In 2023, daily/almost daily use remained higher among males (7%, unchanged from 7% in 2018) than among females (5%, an increase from 4% in 2018). In 2023 daily/almost daily use remained higher among Canadians aged 16-19 years (9%, unchanged from 7% in 2018) and 20-24 years (11%, unchanged from 12% in 2018) than among people age 25+ (5.3%, an increase from 4.6% in 2018). While cannabis smoking decreased, it remained the most common consumption method Smoking cannabis decreased from 89% in 2018 and 70% in 2022 to 63% in 2023. Eating/drinking cannabis increased from 43% in 2018 to 55% in 2023 and remained stable between 2022 and 2023. Vaping cannabis (including vaping dried cannabis and/or liquid or solid cannabis extracts) was unchanged between 2018 and 2023 and decreased between 2022 (36%) and 2023 (33%). Cannabis sourcing More Canadians purchased cannabis from a legal source In 2023, 73% of those who reported using cannabis in the past 12 months reported usually purchasing their cannabis from a legal source (storefront or website), an increase from 4% in 2018 and 69% in 2022. This included 67% who reported purchasing from a legal storefront (up from 61% in 2022) and 5% who reported purchasing from a legal website (down from 8% in 2022). Fifteen percent (15%) of people reported obtaining their cannabis from a social source (shared around a group of friends, from a friend, family member or acquaintance), a decrease from 2018 (60%) and 2022 (18%). Five percent (5%) reported growing their own cannabis or having it specifically grown for them, a decrease from 2018 (7%) and 2022 (8%). Only 3% of people reported purchasing from an illegal source (illegal store, illegal website or dealer), down from 2018 (28%) and unchanged from 2022 (4%). Two percent (2%) reported getting their cannabis from a storefront located in a First Nations community (new in 2023). Explore the data in Figure 3 Average monthly spending on cannabis in the past 12 months decreased since 2018 The amount typically spent per month on cannabis decreased from $73 in 2018 to $63 in 2023 and was unchanged between 2022 ($65) and 2023 ($63). Knowledge and attitudes Canadians who had used cannabis are more likely to believe it can be habit-forming but less likely to endorse other risks Approximately 7 out of 10 (69%) Canadians reported \u00e2\u0080\u0098somewhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098strongly\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agreeing that they had enough trustworthy information about the health risks of cannabis use to make informed decisions, a decrease compared to both 2019 and 2022 (71% and 72%, respectively). Those who had used cannabis in the past 12 months were more likely to agree (84%) than those who had not (63%). In 2023, the majority (90%) of Canadians believed that cannabis use can be habit-forming, an increase from 82% in 2018 and unchanged from 2022 (89%). This was more common among those who had used cannabis in the past 12 months (92%) than those who had not (89%). The majority of Canadians (87%) reported that it is not okay to use cannabis while pregnant or breastfeeding, a decrease from 2019 (98%) but unchanged from 2022 (86%). This was more common among those who had not used cannabis in the past 12 months (88%) than those who had (83%). Just under 7 in 10 (68%) Canadians believed that daily or almost daily cannabis use increases the risk of mental health problems, a decrease from 2019 (89%) but up from 2022 (66%). This was more common among those who had not used cannabis in the past 12 months (70%) than those who had (61%). Perception that smoking and vaping cannabis regularly carries moderate or great risk has increased since 2018 Compared to 2018, perceived \u00e2\u0080\u0098moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098great\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk increased for smoking cannabis (75%, up from 72%) and vaping* cannabis (78%, up from 70%). Perceived moderate or great risk of eating/drinking cannabis decreased compared to 2018 (63%, down from 66%).

Explore the data in Figure 4 Driving and cannabis use Fewer people operated a vehicle after cannabis use in the past 12 monthsFootnote 4 Seventeen percent (17%) of people who had used cannabis in the past 12 months reported driving after cannabis use, a decrease from 27% in 2018. This included 12% who reported driving within 2 hours of smoking or vapourizing cannabis and 8% who reported driving within 4 hours of ingesting cannabis in the past 12 months. In 2023, rates were higher among males than females (19% vs. 14%, respectively) but did not differ by age group. In 2023, 86% of Canadians believed that cannabis use impairs one's ability to drive Among those who have used cannabis in the past 12 months, 79% felt that cannabis use impairs one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to drive, 13% responded that it depends, and 5% responded that it did not impair one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to drive. Approximately a quarter (24%) of Canadians believe it is \u00e2\u0080\u0098extremely likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that a driver would be caught driving under the influence of cannabis. An additional 37% believe a driver is \u00e2\u0080\u0098somewhat likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to be caught driving under the influence of cannabis, down from 2018 and 2022 (40% and 39%, respectively). Those who used cannabis in the past 12 months were less likely to believe it is \u00e2\u0080\u0098extremely likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that a driver would be caught driving under the influence of cannabis than people who had not used cannabis (20% and 26%, respectively).

Follow-up contrasts were conducted to examine year to year comparisons.

At times the text may state that the difference is unchanged, even though the numbers are not identical. This occurs when the difference between numbers is not statistically significant. The statistical significance is indicated in the text description tables located under each figure. For additional details about the survey and methodology, refer to 2018 Canadian Cannabis Survey, the 2019 Canadian Cannabis Survey, the 2020 Canadian Cannabis Survey, the 2021 Canadian Cannabis Survey, 2022 Canadian Cannabis Survey, and the 2023 Canadian Cannabis Survey. Return to footnote 2 referrer Footnote 3 When recruited, respondents were informed that the survey was about cannabis. This may have created a participation bias, where people who use cannabis may have been more likely to complete the survey. For this and other methodological reasons, the CCS prevalence estimates for cannabis use may be higher than reported in other Canadian population level surveys. Return to footnote 3 referrer Footnote 4 The question regarding driving after cannabis use changed from 2018 to 2019, and remained consistent from 2019 onwards (2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023). In 2018, the question only asked if the person drove within 2 hours of any cannabis use. From 2019-2023 two questions were asked: drove within 2 hours of smoking/vaping cannabis and drove within 4 hours of ingesting cannabis. In order to compare 2018 responses to those in other years, questions were combined to capture driving within 2 hours of smoking/vaping and/or within 4 hours of ingesting cannabis.

Quick Stats Data Tool Publications The federal health portfolio has conducted surveillance on child maltreatment as a public health issue since the 1990s. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is now releasing the Child Maltreatment Surveillance Indicator Framework, to take its place alongside other PHAC frameworks, such as the Suicide Surveillance Indicator Framework. Based on a scoping review of existing reviews and meta-analyses, this Framework, along with the online interactive data tool, presents child maltreatment outcome indicators and risk and protective factors at the individual, family, community and societal levels, disaggregated by sex, age and other sociodemographic variables. This Framework will function as a valuable resource pertaining to an issue that affects at least one in three Canadian adults.

Notes: GSS (2014): The estimates in this indicator framework were calculated in a manner consistent with those from the Statistics Canada report Family Violence in Canada: A statistical profile 2015, using a slightly different version of the database. All positive responses to all childhood maltreatment questions were counted as indicating maltreatment. In contrast, the original analysis rules for the Childhood Experiences of Violence Questionnaire (CEVQ) include all positive responses, except for two of the physical abuse subtypes (the less severe ones) and exposure to intimate partner violence if it occurred less than 3 times. Adult is defined as persons 18+ years; Children as persons under 18 years. Parental characteristics, not child characteristics, were considered as risk or protective factors for child maltreatment. This is based on a public health perspective that parental risk factors may represent potential outcomes of child maltreatment (such as prenatal substance use or violence). In the SYC-Child (Survey of Young Canadians, Child component), the person answering these questions is confirmed at the beginning of the questionnaire to be the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) about the following questions.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Canada Published: (2018-05-01) COPD is a chronic disease that is characterised by shortness of breath, cough and sputum production. The disease is progressive (i.e. it tends to get worse over time) and debilitating. It primarily affects the population age 35 years and older. Long-term exposure to lung irritants is the primary cause of COPD. In Canada and other developed nations, the primary irritant that causes COPD is tobacco smoke. Individuals living with COPD often find that the disease limits their mobility and impacts their ability to engage in activities of daily living. Although there is currently no cure for COPD, its symptoms can be managed with medications, other therapies and lifestyle changes. Early detection through lung function testing is key to managing COPD and slowing its progression. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) works with the provinces and territories, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS), to collect and report national surveillance data on COPD. PHAC recently released the publication, Report from the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System: Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Canada, 2018, that describes the burden of chronic respiratory diseases in Canada in more detail. 2 million Over 2 million (10%) Canadians aged 35 years and older were living with diagnosed COPD in 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013. [PHAC CCDSS] 82% The number of Canadians aged 35 years and older living with diagnosed COPD increased by 82% \u00e2\u0094\u0080 from 1.1 million to a little over 2 million \u00e2\u0094\u0080 between 2000\u00e2\u0094\u00802001 and 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013. [PHAC CCDSS] The increase in the number of Canadians living with COPD is being driven by the aging of the population. Would you like to see how the proportion of Canadians (35+) living with diagnosed COPD changed over the years? Check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below. 1 in 116 Out of every 116 Canadians aged 35 years and older, 1 was newly diagnosed with COPD in 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013. In 2000\u00e2\u0094\u00802001, this estimate was 1 in 93. [PHAC CCDSS] Aging and COPD The likelihood of having COPD increases with age. In 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013, 15% of seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 were living with COPD; for seniors aged 85 years and older, 26% were living with COPD. In younger age groups, women and men are about equally likely to have COPD, while in older age groups, men are more likely to be affected. This may be due to smoking being more common among men than women. [PHAC CCDSS] Would you like to explore COPD statistics by age-group and sex? Check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below. Men vs. Women Men are more likely than women to have COPD. However, the gap between men and women with COPD has gradually narrowed over the years.

The reporting year reflects data collected for the period of January 1 to December 31. Last updated: 2024-01-29 Download page in PDF format Download data in CSV format Starting in 2018, the Food and Drug Regulations require manufacturers, importers and compounders to report annual sales of List A ingredients (Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Category I, II, III, and Uncategorized Medically Important Antimicrobials) intended for use in animals. To meet this requirement, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada designed and developed the online reporting tool, the Veterinary Antimicrobial Sales Reporting (VASR) system. The information on this page includes the quantity of sales (measured in kilograms) of medically important antimicrobials by manufacturers and importers, and excludes compounders (unless otherwise noted). CIPARS-VASR reports the quantity of antimicrobials sold in four ways: 1) total kilograms, 2) milligrams per Canadian PCU (mg/PCUCA), 3) milligrams per European PCU (mg/PCUEU), and 4) milligrams per biomass at slaughter (mg/biomassSL). The population correction unit (PCU) is a measure of animal biomass that accounts for the number of animals and their average weight at treatment (using either average Canadian or European weights). The biomass at slaughter is a measure of animal biomass that accounts for the number of production animals and their Canadian average weight at slaughter. Production animals include both horses and food animals (beef and dairy cattle, veal calves, poultry, pigs, sheep, goats, and aquaculture). For additional information, please visit the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) and Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Veterinary Antimicrobial Sales Reporting (VASR).

Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month Published: (2018-01-16) Cancer is a disease that occurs when the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cells do not develop, function and reproduce normally resulting in lumps or tumours that can invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Colorectal cancer is a malignant tumour that starts in the cells of the colon or rectum, most often in the cell walls that line them. The colon and rectum are parts of the large intestine and digestive system responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from food and eliminating wastes. The Public Health Agency of Canada monitors national cancer patterns and outcomes and produces needed information for cancer prevention and control programs, to help reduce the burden of cancer in Canada. 2nd In 2017, colorectal cancer was the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths and 2nd most common cancer in Canada. [PHAC] 1 in 9 1 in 9 cancers diagnosed in 2017 was colorectal cancer. 1 in 9 cancer deaths in 2017 was caused by colorectal cancer. [CCS, 2017] 26,800 An estimated 26,800 colorectal cancers were diagnosed in 2017. With an aging and growing Canadian population, the number of colorectal cancers is expected to exceed 35,000 in 2030.

        "content": "Congenital anomalies, also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or congenital malformations, are usually structural or functional in nature. They are identified prenatally, at birth, or sometimes may only be detected later in life. Approximately 50% of all congenital anomalies cannot be linked to a specific cause; however there are some known risk factors which include genetics and environmental contaminants. Congenital anomalies are the leading cause of infant mortality, resulting in significant long term impacts on individuals, families and health-care systems. This makes them an important perinatal health issue. Public health strategies such as folic acid fortification and supplementation have proven useful in Canada to prevent neural tube defects. Maintaining national surveillance data is a core role of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and crucial in preventing and controlling congenital anomalies and other adverse perinatal outcomes (1). It serves to provide timely identification of epidemiological trends, estimate the burden of congenital anomalies, shed light on potential risk factors and guide research. The Congenital Anomalies data tool was developed by the Canadian Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System (CCASS) to present prevalence rates, temporal trends and certain factors associated with congenital anomalies in Canada, using data from the Discharge Abstract Database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information as well as data from the Quebec congenital anomalies program, which utilises the Maintenance et exploitation des donn\u00e9es pour l'\u00e9tude de la client\u00e8le hospitali\u00e8re (MED-\u00c9CHO). This resource is a collaborative effort between the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System's External Advisory Committee and the Canadian Congenital Anomalies Surveillance Provincial and Territorial Network. The data presented here provides an overview of 38 selected congenital anomalies (grouped into 12 categories) in Canada from 2006 to 2020 using a follow-up period of one year after birth, with the exception of data from Quebec which includes data from 2008 to 2020. This updated version of the data tool has been modified from previous versions and the data is presented by \u2018confirmed' and \u2018suspected' status where possible. Suspected cases are identified by a prefix in the database which indicates that there may be some uncertainty in the diagnosis. Confirmed cases do not include this prefix and are assumed to be established diagnoses. The table below provides a summary of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) codes used for each anomaly/group of anomalies. Data with small cells (under 5) have either been suppressed or combined. Additional information on specific conditions can be requested through CCASS."

The level of COVID-19 activity for each jurisdiction is determined by provincial and territorial ministries of health. The weekly COVID-19 activity level is based on: percent positivity long-term care facility outbreaks per 1,000,000 population, and wastewater trends. Figure 1.

For more information on public health recommendations or risk assessments, please refer to the provincial and territorial websites. More information on COVID-19 activity levels, how they are calculated, and relevant data caveats, can be found in the Technical Notes. COVID-19 activity level technical notes and definitions COVID-19 activity levels are based on data from provincial and territorial (PT) partners. National COVID-19 activity levels were developed with PT partners to monitor COVID-19 activity at the national and PT levels using a standard set of core indicators. Based on these indicators, COVID-19 activity can range from level 0 (no activity) to level 4 (high activity). They are presented with the overall change (increase, decrease, no change) from the previous week. Indicators: The overall COVID-19 activity level is assessed based on the following three indicators, where available: Weekly percent positivity Weekly number of lab positive tests / Weekly total number of tests x 100. Note: This indicator is only incorporated into overall assessment if the testing rate is greater than or equal to 100 tests per 100,000 population per week. This indicator is used to provide information about overall activity level and trajectory. Weekly long term care facility (LTCF) outbreaks per 1,000,000 population Weekly number of LTCF outbreaks / Total population in jurisdiction x 1,000,000. Note: This indicator is used to provide information on overall activity level and trajectory. Weekly COVID-19 wastewater trajectory Trajectory of weekly COVID-19 wastewater viral levels compared to the previous week. Note: This indicator is used to provide information on overall trajectory only. Assessment process: Each indicator is assigned a level ranging from \u00e2\u0080\u0098no activity detected\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (level 0) to \u00e2\u0080\u0098very high activity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (level 4), based on established thresholds (increasing, decreasing, or no change) of a change of 10% or more compared to the previous week. Overall activity level is then determined using the average level of the available indicators (rounding to the nearest whole number). Overall trajectory, or the direction of change (based on 10% change compared to the previous week), is calculated based on the mode of the trajectories from available indicators. Data assessment caveats: This information is based on data from PT partners. For more up to date information and for public health recommendations or risk assessments, please refer to PT websites. Weekly changes in tests performed, and LTCF outbreaks reflect changes in counts between the end of the latest epidemiological week and the end of the previous epidemiological week. Data are updated on an ongoing basis and are subject to change. PT testing practices, data sources and reporting to PHAC vary across jurisdictions. There may be variations in the COVID-19 activity across a jurisdiction. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that if there are outbreaks occurring in one area, it may result in a higher level of COVID-19 activity. Weekly activity level assessments are intended to provide a high-level overview of COVID-19 spread using standard indicators at the national and PT level. They may not reflect the true extent of geographic spread of COVID-19.

Doses administered: Data source Reports from provinces and territories Our provincial and territorial partners share data with PHAC on the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered through the Canadian COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Surveillance System (CCVCSS). These data includes age group, sex, vaccine product used, and dose number. Data are processed using an in-house system that includes a database hosted by Health Canada's server. Doses administered: Data caveats and limitations Differences between federal and provincial or territorial numbers There may be differences in the number of vaccine doses we report as administered and the number that provinces and territories report on their websites. Vaccines doses administered Where possible, the number of doses administered includes all doses administered by a province or territory, regardless of where the person receiving the vaccine lives. Data by dose number were not available for Quebec before March 13, 2022. Data are not available for Ontario as of February 25, 2024. The number of vaccine doses administered is not the same as the number of people vaccinated. This is because, for some people, 2 doses or more are recommended to complete the primary series (such as for moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals). Thus, this information should not be used as a substitute for vaccination coverage estimates. The number of vaccine doses administered may be higher than those reported due to reporting delays. Vaccination coverage: Definitions Vaccination status The following vaccination status categories are not mutually exclusive. At least 1 dose: People who have received a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of the number of doses. People in this category may have received 1 or more doses. Vaccinated per recommendations: People who are \u201cvaccinated per recommendations\u201d includes people who: received the recommended number of XBB.1.5 vaccines (the newest COVID-19 vaccine) for their age group and health status or in the last 6 months, were vaccinated per previous recommendations (completed their primary series or received a booster dose) Received an XBB.1.5 vaccine: People who received XBB.1.5 as their most recent COVID-19 vaccine. Reporting values Report week: The last day included in the cumulative data update. For example, the report dated February 25, 2024 includes data from when COVID-19 vaccination began in Canada (December 14, 2020) up to and including February 25, 2024. Cumulative number: The total number of people given a COVID-19 vaccine, beginning from when vaccination began in Canada (December 14, 2020) up to the report week. Cumulative percent: The percent of the population that has been given a COVID-19 vaccine. This is calculated by dividing the \u201cCumulative number\u201d by the estimated population size and multiplying by 100. Not reported: Data is labelled as \u201cnot reported\u201d when a jurisdiction provides data that has not been broken down into relevant categories. Unknown: Data is labeled as \u201cunknown\u201d when a jurisdiction does not know the value of a particular variable for 1 or more vaccine recipients. For example, if the age group of a vaccine recipient is unknown, they would report that recipient's age group as unknown. n/a: \u201cn/a\u201d stands for \u201cnot applicable\u201d or \u201cnot available\u201d. It is used: in the figure text descriptions when a value does not exist or the information is not available in place of the cumulative percent when a variable value (for example, the age group of the vaccine recipient) is unknown and there is no appropriate denominator indicate that the information is not available because it was not reported by a particular jurisdiction Vaccination coverage: Data sources Numerator data Provincial and territorial partners share data with us about the number of people who were vaccinated against COVID-19, through the CCVCSS. From December 19, 2020 to April 10, 2022, provinces and territories reported every week. From April 24 until May 08, 2022, they reported every 2 weeks. From May 22, 2022, to April 23, 2023, they reported every 4 weeks. Starting June 18, 2023, they reported every 12 weeks. The data includes age group, sex, vaccine used and vaccination status. Data is processed using an in-house system that includes a database hosted by Health Canada's server. Denominator data Denominator data were provided by Statistics Canada and territorial governments. Statistics Canada population size estimates by age, sex and province or territory were derived from 2016 Census of Population counts adjusted for Census net under-coverage and growth using several different administrative files.

The following table provides a summary of what data was not available for each jurisdiction by report week. Data availability Differences between federal and provincial or territorial numbers Vaccination coverage estimates released by provinces and territories may differ from those provided in this report due to: the availability of updated data differences in reporting periods the methodology used to calculate the number of people vaccinated in the last 6 months Occasionally, provinces and territories may report on individuals who were vaccinated in their jurisdiction but who live in another jurisdiction. This can result in an overestimation of vaccination coverage estimates in the vaccinating province or territory and an underestimation of coverage in the province or territory of residence. Data suppression Data are suppressed in this report if a province or territory has concerns around releasing values less than 5 for their jurisdiction. Provinces and territories that suppress values less than 5 include Saskatchewan, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Yukon and Northwest Territories. Generally, if a province or territory requiring data suppression has a category with a value of less than 5, some counts are reclassified as \u201cunknown.\u201d This is done to reduce the number of values that must be suppressed. Remaining values less than 5 after recategorization are then removed from provincial or territorial and national totals to prevent the value from being calculated. Age calculation Caution should be used when comparing vaccination coverage by age groups over time and across provinces and territories. For all provinces and territories, except Alberta and Nunavut, age calculation is based on when these data are extracted and reported to PHAC. Alberta calculates age based on when the person received their latest dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Nunavut calculates age based on the date the person received their first COVID-19 vaccination in Nunavut. Eligible population COVID-19 vaccination began in Canada on December 14, 2020. You're currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination if you're 6 months of age or older and you don't have contraindications to the vaccine. For current recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccination, please refer to: statements issued by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), or a summary of these statements in the COVID-19 chapter of the Canadian Immunization Guide. For a list of the vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada, please refer to Health Canada's Approved COVID-19 vaccines page. For local information on COVID-19 vaccination, please see your provincial or territorial COVID-19 vaccination website. Population size estimates Population size estimates were calculated using the most recent and reliable information available at Statistics Canada. As approximations and rounding were applied to the data when defining these groups, these numbers are estimates. The true size of these populations may be larger or smaller, which could affect coverage estimates. For information on the data quality of the 2016 population census, please consult the Guide to the Census of Population, 2016, Catalogue no. 98-304-X. For information on Census concepts (including short and long descriptions), please consult the Census Dictionary. For information on the methods and data quality of demographic estimates, please consult the Population and Family Estimation Methods at Statistics Canada, Catalogue no. 91-528-X. Updates We may update the format and content of this report based on NACI recommendations, as COVID-19 vaccination programs evolve, and as additional COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use in Canada."

Last updated: 2024-02-09 Download page in PDF format About the dashboard Viral signal trend Variants Technical notes About the dashboard Viral signal trend Variants Technical notes We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with our partners across Canada as part of a pan-Canadian wastewater monitoring network to track the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Our partners include municipal, provincial and territorial governments, as well as other federal departments and academia. The wastewater dashboard allows you to track and compare COVID-19 levels over time in some communities in Canada. It provides a weekly breakdown of COVID-19 variants circulating across Canada. Over time as the virus grows and spreads, it gains small changes in its genetic material. These changes are mutations that produce new variants of the virus. The data comes from sewage samples submitted for testing to the National Microbiology Laboratory or participating partner laboratories. Trend data are presented as 7-day rolling averages, and are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Genomic data summarize the lineages detected over a recent 10-week period. Some communities monitor their own wastewater and publish their own data. For more information, please refer to the list of Canadian wastewater COVID-19 monitoring dashboards and websites. Why we monitor wastewater The virus that causes COVID-19 is shed in the stool (feces) of people while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re infected. Even if a person doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have symptoms, they still shed the virus in their feces, urine or while brushing their teeth. The virus can then be detected by testing the community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wastewater. Wastewater monitoring only detects the virus in a community or institution. It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t identify single cases or households. By monitoring wastewater we can: monitor COVID-19 in communities detect the presence of COVID-19 in institutional settings such as long-term care facilities track which variants are circulating monitor other public health threats, including other infectious diseases and emerging trends in antimicrobial resistance Wastewater monitoring can provide an early warning of COVID-19 in a community or setting. This facilitates an early public health response, which may also include reminding the public about personal protective measures. Wastewater monitoring partners We thank participating municipalities for submitting wastewater samples and associated data. We also thank federal, provincial and territorial public health professionals for valued input on the development of this program, as well as the many scientists supporting wastewater monitoring networks nationally.

Dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease) in Canada Published: (2020-09-17) What is it? Dementia is an umbrella term that describes a set of symptoms affecting brain function. It happens when cells in the brain die or important nerve connections are broken. This process is known as neurodegeneration. Dementia may be caused by neurodegenerative diseases (affecting brain neurons), vascular diseases (affecting blood vessels, like arteries and veins), and injuries. Common types of dementia include: Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease dementia vascular dementia mixed dementia frontotemporal dementia Lewy body dementia Common symptoms of dementia include: memory loss judgement and reasoning problems changes in behaviour, mood and communication abilities Who is affected?Footnote 1 In 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017, more than 432,000 individuals aged 65 years and older were living with diagnosed dementia in Canada. Of these individuals, 2/3 are women. About 9 Canadians are diagnosed with dementia every hour. The risk of being diagnosed with dementia doubles with every 5-year increase in age, between the ages of 65 and 84. See our infographic for a visual summary of key national statistics on dementia. What are the health impacts? Dementia can lead to major health impacts. For example: Of Canadians living in the community with dementia, 49% reported having fair or poor general health and 58% reported limitations in their mobility (independent physical movement).Footnote 2 Of Canadians living in long-term care with dementia, 31% had signs of depression.Footnote 3 Overall, the risk of dying from any cause in 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017 was 4.4 times higher among Canadians aged 65 years and older with diagnosed dementia compared to those without dementia.Footnote 1 Many factors impact someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health. Certain individuals may be more likely to be affected by chronic conditions, like dementia. Some may be at higher risk of developing the condition, while others may face significant barriers to care, which could help reduce dementia health impacts. Read the National Dementia Strategy (Chapter 6) to learn more about dementia and health equity. Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population is also aging. This means that more Canadians are living longer, and many will develop chronic conditions, including dementia. Working to promote healthy aging and to limit these health impacts will become even more important for the future. Changing the face of care Individuals with dementia often require care and support from a variety of care providers, including personal support workers, family/friend caregivers and health professionals. About 26 hours per week of informal care is required for Canadians aged 65 and over living with dementia, compared to 17 hours for those without.Footnote 4 Caregivers are spending $4,600 out-of-pocket annually for each person living with dementia under their care.Footnote 5 45% of caregivers for individuals with dementia show symptoms of distress, compared to 25% of caregivers for individuals without dementia.Footnote 4 What is the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) doing? Surveillance and data To support the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, PHAC is exploring new ways to expand national data on dementia. Improving dementia surveillance will provide a more accurate picture of the impact of dementia in Canada. In collaboration with all Canadian provinces and territories, PHAC collects, analyzes and shares data on diagnosed dementia, including Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS). To identify people with the condition, a validated case definition is applied to provincial and territorial health insurance registry records linked using a unique personal identifier to the corresponding physician billing claims, hospital discharge abstract records and prescription drug records. This system aids the planning and evaluation of health policies, programs, and services. Most recent data from the CCDSS are available on the Public Health Infobase in the CCDSS Data Tool. Policy and program PHAC is working with partners at home and abroad to help reduce the risks of developing dementia and improve the quality of life for those affected by dementia. PHAC investments support individuals living with dementia, caregivers and all people living in Canada. This includes funding to: increase awareness towards reducing risk and stigma improve access to and use of dementia guidance, such as treatment guidelines and best practices for early diagnosis support community-based projects that aim to address the challenges of dementia Looking at dementia through a healthy aging lens, PHAC hopes to reduce the impact of dementia on society and to support the aging population.

It is a chronic condition that usually gets more severe over time.Footnote 1 Symptoms can include: a decline in memory, planning, language and judgement changes in mood and behaviour physical changes (e.g. loss of coordination and bladder control, weak and stiff muscles, mobility issues) According to national data (2020-2021Footnote *), of Canadians 65+: Close to 477,000 live with diagnosed dementia; almost 2/3 are women. Almost 10 are diagnosed with dementia every hour. The risk of being diagnosed with dementia is more than 6 times higher for those aged 80+ compared to those aged 65-79. Adjusting for population aging, the rate of newly diagnosed dementia cases has decreased over the last 10 years, and the proportion of those living with dementia has decreased in the past 5 years. The mortality rate (from any cause) in Canadians with diagnosed dementia is 5.1 times higher than that of Canadians without. Not everyone develops the conditions as they age. Though dementia causes are currently not all known, the risk of getting dementia generally increases with age. The risk may be reduced by staying physically and socially active, avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, wearing a helmet when biking or skiing, as well as managing chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.Footnote 2 If you or someone close to you are worried about dementia, talk to a health care provider.

Diabetes in Canada Published: (2019-11-14) Diabetes is a common chronic condition that affects Canadians of all ages. It occurs when the body loses its ability to produce or properly use insulin, a hormone that regulates sugar levels in the blood. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. If left uncontrolled, diabetes results in high blood sugar levels, which can lead to serious complications. Fortunately, it is possible to remain healthy with diabetes, so long as it is well managed. Prevalence Incidence rate of diabetes for both males females sexes in Use the map below to discover diabetes estimates in Canada's provinces and territories. Navigate the map using Tab or Hover. Description Hover Over a province to see more What are the different types of diabetes? Type 1 diabetes occurs when cells responsible for the production of insulin, found in the pancreas, are destroyed by the body's immune system. This is why this type of diabetes is called an \"autoimmune\" disease. In order to function, a person whose pancreas isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t producing any insulin or very little must rely on daily medication \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the intake of insulin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to regulate their blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes typically develops in children and youth, but can also occur in adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form. It happens when the pancreas doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce enough insulin or the body cannot properly use the insulin the pancreas produces. The risk of developing this metabolic disorder is higher in certain ethnic populations and people who are physically inactive, overweight, or obese. Type 2 diabetes usually affects adults over the age of 40, but can be found in children and youth. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs only in pregnant women, when high blood sugar levels develop during pregnancy. Although it is temporary and usually disappears weeks after delivery, women who have it are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes later. How many Canadians live with diabetes? 1 in 9 About 11% of Canadian adults aged 20+ live with diagnosed diabetes. 1 in 333 About 0.3% of Canadian children and youth aged 1-19 live with diagnosed diabetes. 1 in 10 The rate of pregnant women with diagnosed diabetes (both pre-existing and gestational) is 99.1 per 1000 total births. 549 per day On average, 549 new cases of diabetes are diagnosed each day in Canada. Profile of diabetes in Canada Type 1 vs type 2 About 10% of Canadians with diabetes have type 1 and 90% have type 2. [PHAC 2011] Males vs females Diabetes is more common among adult men (11.8%) than women (10.0%), while in children and youth, the rates are the same for boys and girls. Young vs old While only 0.3% of diabetes cases are among Canadians between the ages of 1 to 19, 55% of the cases are among Canadians aged 65+. Time trends: going up or down? An increase of 3.3% \u00e2\u0086\u0091 The prevalence of Canadians living with diagnosed diabetes went up by an average of 3.3% every year from 2000 to 2016. Numbers are expected to continue rising due to an aging Canadian population and the fact that Canadians are living longer with diabetes. Each year, there are approximately 201,000 new cases of diabetes, or 549 new cases per day. Since 2000, age-standardized incidence rates have remained relatively stable. An decrease of 2.1% \u00e2\u0086\u0093 From 2000 to 2016, the mortality rate for those with diabetes decreased by an average of 2.1% per year. The all-cause mortality rate among Canadians with diabetes is twice as high as the all-cause mortality rate for those without diabetes. Hover or tab over the bars for more information What is the history of diabetes surveillance in Canada? Since 1999, the Government of Canada has reported on rates of diabetes in Canada using the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS). The CCDSS is supported by a pan-Canadian partnership between the Public Health Agency of Canada and all provinces and territories. Since it began, the CCDSS has expanded and now covers a wide range of health diseases and conditions and is able to provide a broad overview of the health of Canadians.

Differences in obesity rates between rural communities and urban cities in Canada What is obesity and how is it measured? Obesity is a complex condition in which excess body fat poses a risk to health1. Body Mass Index (BMI) is the primary measure used to track obesity in the Canadian population. BMI is a measure of a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight in relation to their height squared2. All estimates are taken from the Canadian Risk Factor Atlas (CRFA) using pooled data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, 2015-2018. About 1 in 4 Canadian adults (26.6%) are currently living with obesity. Obesity rates in Canadian adults are higher in men compared to women (28.0% versus 24.7%, respectively). Geography and health are closely interconnected. Where we live greatly influences how we live and has a direct effect on our health experiences3. What does \"urban\" and \"rural\" mean? Statistics Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Statistical Area Classification divides all Canadian municipalities into two large geographic sets4. Population centres - which we will refer to as \u00e2\u0080\u009curban areas\u00e2\u0080\u009d, consist of areas with a high density concentration of population (i.e. areas with a population of at least 1,000 and a population density of at least 400 persons per km2). Rural area - All areas outside urban areas. The sum of population centres and rural areas cover all Canada. The rural area of Canada includes a combination of population living in rural areas embedded in urban areas as well as outside urban areas. Credit: Image courtesy of Statistics Canada, rural area detailed definition. Accessed November 4, 2020 How does the prevalence of obesity in rural and urban Canada compare? In Canada overall, the rate of obesity is higher for adults living in rural areas compared with those living in urban areas, independently of sex. In rural areas, about 1 in 3 Canadian adults are living with obesity (31.4%) In urban areas, about 1 in 4 Canadian adults are living with obesity (25.6%) This means that there are on average 5.8 more cases of obesity per 100 adults living in rural areas compared with urban areas. Figure 1. Obesity prevalence (%) in Canadian adults by rural-urban place of residence and by sex. Source: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA. Population: Adults aged 18+ years, all Canada and by sex. Geographic trends of obesity observed in adults living in rural communities versus cities across Canada Not all provinces show higher rates of obesity in rural compared to urban areas. Provinces with higher rates of adult obesity in rural compared with urban areas were Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec. In these provinces, rural obesity ranged from 3.1 to 7.4 percentage points higher than urban areas (Quebec 27.3% versus 24.2%; Manitoba 36.1% versus 28.7%). In Saskatchewan and Manitoba the rural rates of obesity were higher for men only, while in Quebec and Alberta the rates of obesity were higher in rural areas for women only. There were no significant differences in obesity rates between adults living in rural versus urban areas in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Figure 2. Obesity prevalence (%) in Canadian adults by provinces and territories and by rural-urban place of residence Source: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA. *Significantly different when comparing rates of obesity among rural versus urban areas of the same province or territory. The prevalence of obesity is higher in small cities compared to large metropolitan cities. When looking at cities in Canada: The lowest rates of adult obesity were observed in the largest urban census metropolitan areas such as Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. In general, obesity rates in adults tend to be higher in smaller cities. The obesity rate in the census agglomerations of Miramichi, Woodstock, Corner Brook, Cape Breton, Yellowknife, Brockville, Dawson Creek, Wood Buffalo and the City of Iqaluit is about 1.5 times the rate of the Canadian average (i.e. greater than 40% versus 26.6%). Figure 3. Municipalities with the lowest and highest rates of obesity in Canada, adults aged 18 + years. Source: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA. Population: Adults aged 18+ years, selected ^^Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), ^Census Agglomeration (CA) and cities. But, the urban-rural disparities in adult obesity are complex and multifactorial! In the past, urbanization was considered one of the most important drivers of the rise in obesity in industrialized countries. Recent global and national studies show that urbanization of rural life has contributed to a larger increase in rural obesity5,6. This change in the geographic distribution of obesity can be partly explained by the growing economic and social disadvantage that rural communities compared to urban cities experience. In particular, rural communities experience lower education and income, lower availability of healthy and fresh foods at a reasonable cost, less access to public transportation and lack of supportive environments to promote walkability, sports and recreational activities5. Socioeconomic characteristics at the municipality level must be kept in mind to understand urban-rural disparities in obesity rates for adults when interpreting this data. In Canada overall, adult obesity is more prevalent among disadvantaged population groups such as those unemployed or with lower household income and education levels. Figure 4. Obesity prevalence in Canadian adults by socio-economic status. Source: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA. Population: Adults aged 18+ years, all Canada. Key messages Recent global trends show that the prevalence of obesity is rising faster among people living in rural than those living in urban areas. Population based data from 2015 to 2018 shows that, in Canada overall, the rate of obesity is higher in rural versus urban areas (31.4% vs. 25.6%). When looking at cities in Canada: The lowest rates of adult obesity were observed in the largest urban census metropolitan areas. In general, obesity rates in adults tend to be higher in smaller cities. Although adult obesity rates in the territories are among the highest in Canada, there were no urban-rural disparities. In Canada overall, adult obesity is more prevalent among disadvantaged population groups such as those unemployed or with lower household income and education levels. Data on how obesity rates in rural and urban populations is changing may assist policy-makers and local communities to target policies, programs and services aiming to promoting healthy weights at an appropriate geographic level.

Should you need further geographic data granularity, the CRFA is a new dynamic interface that integrates surveillance of key chronic disease and mental health risk factors (e.g. obesity, overweight, physical inactivity, fair or poor perceived health, lack of community support and sense of belonging, etc.) into a geospatial platform at multiple levels of geography from national to large municipalities and cities including the territorial capitals. Data can also be retrieved by other demographic and key socioeconomic determinants of health. References World Health Organization. Obesity and overweight Fact sheet No 311.

Down Syndrome Day \u00e2\u0080\u0093 March 21 Published: (2017-03-21) Down syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality, is one of the most common congenital anomalies (or birth defects) worldwide, and the most common one in Canada. Diagnoses are most often made during pregnancy and the first year of the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Children with Down syndrome present with well-defined physical characteristics. They often experience intellectual delay and are at an increased risk for several medical conditions. Congenital heart defects and respiratory infections are the most frequently reported causes of death in children and young adults with Down syndrome. Childhood leukemia is commonly associated with Down syndrome. However, the life-expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome has improved over time. The Public Health Agency of Canada's Canadian Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System (CCASS) monitors and reports on national estimates and trends of congenital anomalies including Down syndrome. The CCASS is part of the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System (CPSS). The CPSS is a national health surveillance program aiming to contribute to the improved health of pregnant women, mothers and infants in Canada. 21 Down syndrome occurs due to the presence of an extra chromosome 21.

[Down Syndrome Surveillance in Canada, 2005-2013] 15.8 In the last decade, the average rate of Down syndrome in Canada has been 15.8 per 10,000 total births. [Down Syndrome Surveillance in Canada, 2005-2013] 35+ Women 35 years of age and older are more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome than younger women. [Down Syndrome Surveillance in Canada, 2005-2013] 52% Despite the increased risk to older women, there are more babies with Down syndrome born to younger women (aged 34 and younger). That can be explained by the fact that 52% of total births occur in women under 35 years due to higher fertility rates in younger women.

Last updated: 2023-07-24 Water activities, such as swimming, canoeing and kayaking are popular in Canada. While offering individuals numerous health benefits, activities that take place in bodies of water (even bathing!) require many safety considerations. Presented below are statistics highlighting non-fatal and fatal drowning events, using the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database, the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) and the Canadian Vital Statistics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Death Database (CVSD). What is drowning? Drowning is defined as a process of experiencing breathing difficulties resulting from being in or under a liquid, such as waterFootnote 1. Such an injury can cause serious, long-term health outcomes to individuals and be fatal. Emergency Departments (CHIRPP database) How many cases were there? Between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023, there were 1,109 drowning-related cases reported in CHIRPP, representing 58.6 cases/100,000 CHIRPP records. Of the 1,109 drowning-related cases, males accounted for more than half (58.9%) of the emergency department (ED) visits. Infants and children aged 9 years or younger represented the largest percentage at 79.2% (n = 878)Footnote *. A total of 35 drowning fatalities have been reported in CHIRPP since 2011. Of those, children aged between 2 and 9 years accounted for 60.0% of cases (n = 21). When do drownings happen? Drownings happen year-round. The majority of cases (73.0%; n = 810) occurred during warmer months (May, June, July, August and September), among which 507 cases involved swimming pools (62.5%) and 176 cases, natural bodies of water. There were 200 cases (18.0%) reported during the colder months (January, February March, November and December). Half of these cases (n =100) occurred in bathtubs and 80 in swimming pools (40.0%). Where do drownings happen? Swimming Pool Of all 1,109 drowning cases, the majority (56.3%; n = 624) occurred in residential or public swimming pools, among which, 79.6% were infants and children aged 9 years or younger (n = 497). Bathtubs There were 237 reported drownings (21.4%) that occurred in bathtubs, 73.0% of which involved infants aged 1 year or younger (n = 173). Natural Bodies of Water Nearly one-fifth (18.8%; n = 209) of all drownings occurred in natural bodies of water, including ponds, lakes and rivers. The majority of these cases (62.2%) involved infants and children aged 9 years or younger (n = 130). What level of in-hospital treatment was needed? Overall, 42.4% of patients required observation or received medical treatment in the ED (n =470), while 28.5% of patients were admitted to the hospital for treatment (n = 316). Hospitalizations (Discharge Abstract Database) Between fiscal years 2009/10 and 2021/22 there were 2,283 drowning-related hospitalizationsFootnote ** in Canada, excluding Quebec hospitals, an average of 175 per year. Of these cases, 64.4% were males (n = 1,470). Presented in Table 1 is a breakdown of the types of body of water where the drownings occurred. Drownings involving swimming pools had the highest percentage at 34.9%. Among these cases, 65.5% involved children under the age of 15 years (n =521). Drownings involving natural bodies of water represented 29.2% of hospitalizations, among which 72.1% were aged 20 years or older.

How many deaths were due to drownings? In 2020, 323 people died due to unintentional drowningsFootnote ** in Canada, among which nearly half (47%; n =152) occurred in natural bodies water. Between 2015 and 2020, there have been 1,768 reported deaths, an average 294 per year. Swimming Pools Of the 323 deaths, 39 people (12.1%) died from drowning in swimming pools. Of these cases, 43.6% were children between the ages of 1 and 9 years (n = 17). Take Note The results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all drowning cases in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, M\u00c3\u00a9tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. As noted above, hospitalization and death counts are based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) codes W65-W74.

Last updated: 2023-06-29 Fireworks and other pyrotechnic products have gained much popularity in Canada. With their impressive auditory and visual effects, it is not surprising that such products play important roles in celebrating special events. From the Inuvik Sunrise Festival in the Northwest Territories to the Canada Day celebrations occurring in many regions across Canada, such displays attract and amaze large crowds. However, when proper safety precautions are not taken, injuries can occur placing the health of individuals at risk. Presented below are statistics highlighting injuries associated with fireworks and other related products, such as sparklers and firecrackers, reported between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023 in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database. For information on fireworks safety, please see this fireworks safety video. How many cases were there? Between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023, there were 210 reported cases of injuries related to fireworks and other similar products, representing 11 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Age groups Young adults between the ages of 20 and 29 years represented the largest proportion at 22 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records but were closely followed by those aged of 30 and 39 years, who represented 18 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Males vs. females Overall, 67.1% of the patients injured were male (n = 141). Days of the week injury occurred Over half of all injuries (57.1%) occurred on a Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Time of year during which injury occurred Approximately two-thirds of all injuries (66.2%) occurred between May and August. Nearly a third of all injuries (29.0%; n = 61) occurred on days surrounding Victoria Day (May 16 to 24) and Canada Day (June 29 to July 3). Most common injuries The most common type of injuries were burns, representing 61.0% of cases (n = 128), followed by eye injuries at 19.1% (n = 40). Of the 128 burns, the most affected body region was the upper extremity region (hands, fingers and forearms), which represented 55.5% of such cases (n = 71). The head and neck region then followed, representing 25.0% of burns (n = 32). Thirty-eight individuals (18.1%) sustained burns in multiple body regions. What level of in-hospital treatment was needed? Nearly three-quarters of all cases (73.8%) required medical treatments in the emergency departments, and 11.4% of patients were admitted to hospitals. Take note CHIRPP is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 10 general hospitals across Canada. Since its inception in 1990, this database has colected over 4.2 million records, making it an important resource for information on injuries and moving forward programs and policies that aim at reducing and preventing injuries among Canadians. Learn more about the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program. Data extraction was conducted using English and French key word searches in the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 narratives of the injury event and examining factor codes pertaining to injuries concerning fireworks and other related products.

Head Injuries in Children and Youth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Invisible Epidemic Published: (2016-02-09) You might have noticed that head injuries in sport have received a lot of attention lately, and this type of injury is now recognized as a public health problem. In some sports, head injuries are common and their potential short-and long-term consequences can be severe. While all hits to the head can be problematic, repetitive head impact can cause long-term brain damage, and in some cases, even death. Children and youth are particularly at risk of long-term effects following head injuries and concussions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about playing smart, limiting the risk of head injuries while being active. Many sports-related head injuries, including concussions, are preventable and with early and proper detection and care, risks can be minimized. The numbers below are taken from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) surveillance system. To learn more about head injuries related to sports, visit The Public Health Agency of Canada's website. 754 There were 754 sport-related head injuries resulted in hospitalizations among children aged 5 to 19 years old in 2010-2011. [HMDB, 2010-2011] 15,970 An estimated 15,970 patients presented to emergency departments across Canada with a sport-related head injury \u00e2\u0080\u0094including concussions\u00e2\u0080\u0094 in 2011-2012. [NACRS, 2011-2012] 60% In children and youth 10 to 19 years of age, more than half of injuries treated in emergency departments are sports and recreation-related. Of those injuries, head injuries \u00e2\u0080\u0094including concussions\u00e2\u0080\u0094 are among the most common type. [eCHIRPP, 2011-2014] 40% When compared to other types of injuries, head-related injuries from football, soccer and hockey in children and youth increased by 40% between 2004 and 2014. [HPCDP 36(1), January 2016] X The number of children and youth suffering from signs and symptoms of concussion that go undetected and/or untreated is currently unknown. Top 5 Find out which sports and recreational activities are most related to concussions and other brain injuries among Canadian children and youth, 5-19 years old (2012-2014).

Rates encompass incidence and prevalence. Consult the documentation for more details on a specific indicator.Stratification: Where possible/applicable, indicators are stratified at the individual level by the following characteristics: individual respondent/household income (income quintile \u2013 provincial/national, overall and by rural/urban geography); education level/quintile (individual respondent/household, overall and by rural/urban geography); immigration status; First Nations/Inuit/M\u00e9tis identity; employment status; occupation; rural/urban geography; cultural/racial background; sexual orientation; functional health; participation and activity limitation; impact of health problems; first official language spoken; first official language spoken by geography; household living arrangement; dwelling ownership; dwelling type; household size; marital status; self-rated health; self-rated mental health, and LGBTQ2+. In certain cases, categories within a stratifier are collapsed or replaced by a proxy measure in cases of small sample sizes or unavailable information. Consult the documentation for more details on the available stratifiers for a specific indicator.Ecological stratifiers are used in cases of missing or unavailable individual level characteristics. These measures are based on the use of area level measures1 of socio-economic status (e.g. deprivation index; Canadian Index of Multiple Depriation) sub-group (e.g. First Nations/Inuit/M\u00e9tis identity, foreign-born2) concentration and rural/urban geography (remoteness index) derived from the 2006 or 2016 Census (long-form) at the Census Dissemination Area (DA) level and linked to the vital and cancer administrative data available at Statistics Canada using the Postal Code OM Conversion File Plus (PCCF+).Data availability, validity and limitations: When an indicator and a stratifier are crossed, the age interval is limited to that available in both the indicator and the stratifier. The values calculated for the summary measures of inequalities do not take into account the complex intersections between different social identities or different social determinants of health that may vary between the groups. Consult the documentation on the summary measures of inequalities used in this project for more details. Data from national surveys were weighted to permit representative estimates of the target population. The 95% confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a number or a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability and should therefore be interpreted and compared with caution. For indicators using data linkage to the 2006 or 2016 census data via the PCCF+, records that could not be assigned a DA were excluded from the analysis.

Healthy Weights in Canadian ChildrenPublished: (2016-07-26) A healthy weight in childhood is critical to a healthy future Obesity means having too much body fat and it can negatively affect a child's health and well-being. An obese child will likely become an obese adult. Obesity in adulthood has been linked to many conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer and poor emotional health. Childhood obesity levels remain high Over the last 35 years, obesity rates among Canadian children and youth aged 6-17 years have more than doubled, from 6% in 1978/79 to 13% in 2013/14. Over the past 10 years, although there have been efforts to reduce childhood obesity, there has been no significant decline in childhood obesity and rates have remained stable but high. [CMAJ] [Statistics Canada] The Public Health Agency of Canada reports regularly on a variety of factors associated with obesity and provides helpful tips to achieve the healthiest lifestyle possible. A healthy lifestyle in childhood can have long lasting benefits Healthy eating, physical activity, limited sedentary time and adequate sleep, are important to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Eat well 43.6% of youth 12-19 years old report eating fruits or vegetables five or more times a day. Eating fruits and vegetables on a daily basis is a good marker of a healthy diet. Drink water 13.4% of children 5-11 years old and 21.3% of youth 12-17 years old said they drink 1 or more sugar-sweetened beverages every day. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, like fruit-flavoured juice, soft drinks, and sports/energy drinks, has risen dramatically in recent years and can increase the risk of obesity. [Healthy Canadians] Make water your beverage of choice! Choose it instead of beverages that are high in calories or sugar. Be active! 13.6% of children 5-11 years old are achieving the recommended 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-physical activity daily. That number drops to only 5% for older children (12-17 years old). [CSEP Guidelines] Exercise boosts agility, coordination, brain power and intellect! Making it a habit at an early age will provide your child with lifelong health benefits. Limit screen time 75.9% of children 5-11 years old are limiting their screen time to no more than 2 hours per day, as recommended. In contrast, only 25.1% of older children (12-17 years old) are meeting this recommendation. [CSEP Guidelines] Regardless of how much physical activity they are getting, children should have limited screen-based activities. Get your zzzz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 81.8% of children ages 5-11 and 67.0% of youth aged 12-17 are getting adequate daily sleep. [CSEP Guidlines] Getting the right amount and quality of sleep can help reduce the risk of childhood obesity. Dive Into the Data Childhood Obesity Rates by Age Group The table below shows the persistently high levels of obesity among Canadian children and youth in the last decade.

When comparing estimates over time, it is important to keep confidence intervals in mind. If the confidence intervals of two estimates overlap, that means that the two estimates do not, in fact, differ. Conclusions should therefore only be drawn after one has compared estimates and their confidence intervals.

Heart disease in Canada Published: (2018-05-31) Heart disease is a general term used to refer to several diseases of the heart and blood vessels. In Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death and accounted for over 51,500 deaths in 2015.Footnote 1 Heart disease is a condition in which the heart muscle is damaged or does not function properly. Plaque (composed of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances) builds up on the inner walls of coronary arteries and, over time, it can harden or rupture. As a result, the inside of the coronary arteries narrow and the flow of blood to the heart muscle is reduced. A blood clot can also form in a coronary artery when plaque ruptures. In such a case, the flow of blood to the heart muscle is blocked. Commonly known heart diseases include: ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [also known as a heart attack], angina, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and heart failure. Heart disease symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue and sweating, among others. The Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) is a collaborative network of provincial and territorial chronic disease surveillance systems led by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Using data from the CCDSS, estimates are provided from 2000\u00e2\u0080\u00932001 to 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 for the number of Canadians living with heart disease and those who are newly diagnosed. Trends in mortality are also explored. PHAC recently released the publication, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Report from the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System: Heart Disease in Canada, 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that describes epidemiological trends and profiles of IHD, AMI (which is a subset of IHD) as well as heart failure. Who is affected? In 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013, about 2.4 million (or 1 in 12) Canadians aged 20 years and older were living with IHD, the most common type of heart disease. Of those, about 578,000 (2.1%) individuals had a history of AMI. Another 669,600 (3.6%) Canadians adults aged 40 years and older had heart failure. Men vs. Women In any given year observed, more men than women live with or are newly diagnosed with IHD, AMI or heart failure. The only exception is for those aged 85 years and over. Although the rates for these diseases are still higher in men than in women at that age, the difference in rates between the sexes diminishes. Similarly, among individuals with IHD or heart failure, rates of death (due to any cause) were higher in men than in women. However, among those with a history of AMI, women aged 45 to 74 years old were about 1.3 times more likely to die of any cause in a given year compared to men of the same age. One of the factors that may explain poorer outcomes in women with a history of AMI compare to men is the fact that women sometimes have more subtle symptoms which may contribute to delays in seeking medical care. In addition, women tend to have more complications (e.g. major bleeding) than men during hospitalizations. To find out the estimates by age group and sex, check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below. Young vs. Old More Canadians are affected by heart disease as they get older. About two thirds of Canadians who live with IHD and over 80% of those who have heart failure are 65 years or older. Heart disease can develop at a younger age too. As many as 38,000 Canadians aged 20 to 39 years old were living with IHD and over 35,000 Canadians aged 40 to 54 years old were living with heart failure in 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013. To find out the estimates by age group and sex, check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below. Increasing or decreasing? The proportion of Canadians living with IHD and heart failure remained relatively stable over the 13-year period from 2000\u00e2\u0080\u00932001 to 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 while all-cause mortality rates declined respectively by 24% and 26%. The proportion of those with a history of AMI increased by 67% over the same period while all-cause mortality rates declined by close to 35%. These trends are a likely indication of better survival, mostly due to the reduction of certain risk factor and improvements in disease management and treatments. To see trends over the years, check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below.

Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from natural sources (such as the sun) and artificial sources (including industrial equipment and indoor tanning devices) also poses health risksFootnote 2. As our climate continues to change, these types of events are expected to become more severeFootnote 3Footnote 4. With respect to health impacts, hotter extreme temperatures have been linked to an increase in the number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions, as extreme heat can exacerbate certain cardiovascular and respiratory diseasesFootnote 5Footnote 6Footnote 7Footnote 8. While extreme heat can put everyone at risk from heat illnesses, some population groups that are more susceptible to extreme heat include infants and young children, older adults, people with chronic and/or pre-existing illnesses (e.g. pre-existing heart, pulmonary, renal and psychiatric conditions) and people who are experiencing homelessnessFootnote 3Footnote 5Footnote 7Footnote 9. This data blog presents statistics on sun- and heat-related cases reported to the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) between April 1, 2011 and January 12, 2023. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects injury and poisoning data from the EDs of 11 pediatric and 10 general hospitals located across CanadaFootnote 10. Types of sun- and heat-related injuries and illnesses Heat-related illnesses are usually caused by exposure to unusual or lengthened amounts of heat and humidity without adequate fluid intake or relief. They can come on quickly and have serious consequences such as long-term health problems or even death. Overexposure to UV radiation can cause sunburns, skin aging, eye cataracts and skin cancer. Some of the most common types of heat-related illnesses and injuries areFootnote 3Footnote 11Footnote 12Footnote 13Footnote 14: Heat stroke: This heat-related illness is the most severe. It is caused by a rapid increase in body temperature and problems regulating the sweating mechanisms. Heat exhaustion: A disproportionate loss of water and salt caused by exposure to heat (usually due to heavy sweating). People affected may experience a fast and weak pulse rate, dizziness, nausea and muscle cramps. Heat syncope: A fainting episode that is caused by low blood pressure when heat causes the dilation of blood vessels. Heat cramps: Painful muscle spasms caused by a salt imbalance due to sweating. Heat rashes: Skin irritation usually caused by an inflammation of clogged sweat glands accompanied by red spots. Sunburns: This injury is characterized by red, painful and unusually warm skin after overexposure to UV radiation. More severe cases can be accompanied by swelling of the skin, blisters and fever. Emergency Departments (CHIRPP database) Between April 1, 2011, and January 12, 2023, there were 734 sun and heat-related casesFootnote + reported in CHIRPP, representing 39.7 cases per 100 000 CHIRPP records. Males accounted for 57.1% of cases (n = 419). Individuals aged 19 years and younger represented 71.8% of sun- and heat-related cases (n = 527) (Table 1).

Type of Injury As presented in Table 2, sunburns were the most common type of injury, representing 55.4% of all cases (n = 407). The most frequent body parts affected by sunburn injuries were the shoulders (27.0%), followed by the face (25.1%) and the back (13.5%). Over a quarter of all cases (27.5%; n = 202) were diagnosed with a form of heat-related stress or systemic overexertion, ranking this health outcome as the second most common type of injury (Table 2). Nine percent of cases (9.0%; n = 66) were diagnosed with other injuries (e.g., open wound, concussion, dislocation).

Among these cases, although no formal heat stress/overexertion or sunburn diagnosis was given, the injury event description contained information regarding heat or sun exposure or suspected heat illness. When do sun- and heat-related illnesses and injuries happen? Sun- and heat-related illnesses and injuries generally occur during the warmer months. More specifically, 90.3% of sun- and heat-related cases took place during the months of May to August. What were people doing? Where reported, Table 3 shows the event circumstances associated with the two most common types of injuries noted above, namely sunburns and heat stress/systemic overexertion. With respect to sunburns, the most common circumstances were sport participation (33.1%; n = 84), followed by playing outdoors (23.2%; n = 59) and sitting, lying, sleeping and suntanning (13.8%; n = 35)(Table 3). Similar to sunburn injuries, the most common circumstances associated with heat stress/systemic overexertion cases were sport participation (33.1%; n = 56), followed by playing outdoors (14.8%; n = 25) and working (14.8%; n = 25). A closer look at the circumstances: Sunburns Sports and recreational activities: Among the sunburn cases, the four most frequent sports and activities were swimming (53.6%), non-motorized boating (9.5%), water slides (4.8%), and fishing (4.8%). Leisure activities: This category contained an array of activities like woodworking, watching a sports game and going to an outdoor music festival. Heat stress/systemic overexertion Sports and recreational activities: Among the heat stress/overexertion cases, the three most frequent sports and activities were swimming (17.9%), water slides (14.3%) and soccer (10.7%). Working: Various occupations were reported, including firefighting, landscaping, construction work, paramedic work, and lifeguarding. In car or vehicle: All 13 cases in this category occurred among children 4 years of age or younger, who were inadvertently left in or locked in a car.

Where do heat-related illnesses and sunburns happen? Where reported, Table 4 presents the locations concerning the two most common types of sun- and heat-related injuries (sunburns and heat stress/systemic overexertion). Among sunburn injuries, the most frequently reported locations were natural bodies of water, such as a beach, lake, or river (35.8%; n =78), residential settings (23.9%; n = 52), and public parks (12.4%; n = 27). With respect to heat stress/systemic overexertion cases, the most frequently reported locations were public spaces, including sidewalks, streets and parking lots (17.3%; n =23), aquatic recreation facilities (12.8%; n = 17), and residential settings (12.8%; n = 17).

What level of in-hospital treatment was needed? Table 5 shows the level of in-hospital treatment for all reported sun- and heat-related cases. Out of the 734 sun- and heat-related cases, 60.0% required medical treatment in the ED. Additionally, 20 patients (2.7%) were admitted to the hospital, of which, just over half (55.0%) were among males, a quarter (25.0%) were among adults aged 65 years or older and 20.0% were among infants younger than 2 years of age.

Playing outside for long period \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no sunscreen or hat \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has sunburn to face. Homeless, outside without shirt for most of last 2 days, sunburned shoulders. Fell asleep in the sun. Got sunburnt while on vacation. Sunscreen was being used. Watching baseball game, got sunburn on leg. Heat stress/systemic overexertion Playing at water-park - outside for 5 hours - 23 degrees weather. Friend found patient sitting in apartment, apartment too hot. Attending soccer camp, 29 degree Celsius temperature, running a lot, complains of heat exhaustion. Landscaping for 48 hours. Did not hydrate well while outside. Patient was accidentally locked in family car, in car seat for about 15 mins with all windows closed in the sunlight (overheated). While at summer school, felt nausea and dizziness. Air conditioning in school not working. Patient was roofing for couple of hours in the sun and developed headache, nausea and dizziness. Prevention It is important to keep in mind that too much sun or heat can be harmful. Here are a few general, sun- and heat-related safety tips: It is important to protect yourself from UV rays all year round \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even during the winter, on cloudy days or when you are in the water. Apply sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, wear loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing and a wide brimmed hat made of breathable fabrics, and use sunglasses that protect from both UVA and UVB rays. Never leave people or pets alone in a parked vehicle, even if a window is cracked. Reduce the time you spend in the sun and heat. If you can, reschedule outdoor activity to a cooler part of the day or another day. Drink plenty of liquids before you feel thirsty to stay hydrated and avoid heat-related illnesses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 water is best. Spend a few hours in a cool place. It could be a tree-shaded area, swimming facility or an air-conditioned spot. Some medications and illnesses (e.g., cardiac, respiratory and psychiatric conditions) may make you more vulnerable to extreme heat. Ask your healthcare provider if you are at risk.

Thus, the illness and injury estimates from CHIRPP are not representative of the national population. Some reported sunburn injuries may have resulted from industrial sources. Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Climate Change and Innovation Bureau is currently working towards publishing a national-level descriptive epidemiological report on heat injuries/illnesses and deaths in Canada. Adults older than 18 years of age, Indigenous peoples including First Nations, Inuit and M\u00c3\u00a9tis, and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are pediatric hospitals located in major citiesFootnote 10. Thus, while older adults are at greater risk for extreme heat, this group may not be well captured through CHIRPP data. Additionally, fatal injuries are under-represented in the CHIRPP database because the emergency department data does not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another departmentFootnote 10. Information is continuously being entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. References Footnote 1 Government of Canada.

Hospital Births in CanadaPublished: (2016-07-26) Although some births occur in homes and birthing centres, most births in Canada still take place in hospitals. Here are some interesting findings regarding hospital births in 2014 in Canada (excluding Quebec), according to the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System. 26,488 O Canada! July had the most births (26,488) in 2014. [CIHI-DAD, 2014] Halloween The highest number of births (1,026) in a day was on July 24, suggesting that conception took place (on average) on October 31, 2013 (not shown in table). [CIHI-DAD, 2014] 581 The day with the lowest number of births (581) was December 25. [CIHI-DAD, 2014] February Disadvantaged by being the shortest month, February had the lowest number of births (21,531) in 2014. [CIHI-DAD, 2014] Thursday Births occurred most often on Thursdays, followed by Wednesdays and Fridays. The lowest number of births occurred on weekends. [CIHI-DAD, 2014] Jul-Aug-Sept More babies were born in July, August and September compared to other months. [CIHI-DAD, 2014] The Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System (CPSS) monitors and reports on key indicators of maternal, fetal and infant health in Canada.

How has COVID-19 impacted access to STBBI-related health services, including harm reduction services, for African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) people in Canada? Published: (2022-06-02) Since the start of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 pandemic, challenges in delivering healthcare services including sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection (STBBI) prevention, testing and treatment services, including harm reduction services, have been reported across the country. These disruptions may have had a greater impact on populations most at risk for HIV and/or hepatitis C including African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities. Additionally, social determinants of health including mental health, food security and structural barriers in accessing healthcare are known to account for differential health risks and health outcomes among these populations at risk. To better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected access to STBBI-related health services for ACB people, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) conducted an anonymous online survey between May and July 2021. The survey included anyone 18 years or older who was living in Canada during this time and self-identified as a person of ACB background. In total, 1556 people from across Canada participated in the survey. 1556 participants 1/2 51% were under the age of 40 9 in 10 Self-identified as: Black African (63%) Black Caribbean (28%) Less than 1 in 10 self-identified as: Black Indigenous or Black Canadian (7%) Multiracial (7%) Black American (2%) Black Latin American (1%) Another Black race/ethnicity (2%) Note: A participant can self-identify with more than one cultural and racial background 2/3 66% identified as a Cisgender female Note: A participant assigned female at birth who identifies as a woman 1 in 5 18% reported a sexual orientation other than heterosexual or straight 3/4 77% were born outside Canada 2 in 3 64% were Canadian citizens More than 8 in 10 88% had more than a high school education 6 in 10 62% were living with family at the time of survey 1 in 5 20% were living alone at the time of survey Less than 1 in 10 6% were living in precarious or inadequate housing Note: Includes couch surfing, hotel or motel room, shelter or hostel, transition or halfway house, correctional facility and public place like a street, park or stairwell Mental health and wellness 1/2 47% reported their mental health was excellent or very good at the time of survey Less than 1 in 10 6% reported their mental health was poor at the time of the survey 1/3 33% reported their mental health status was worse since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 2/5 42% tried to access mental health services, of whom 62% were not always able to access these services Financial and food security 7 in 10 69% were employed before the COVID-19 pandemic 1/3 36% reported reduced hours and/or pay, or had to stop working since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 3 in 5 61% reported a major, moderate or mild impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ability to pay bills 1/2 53% experienced food insecurity since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Note: Includes households that couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to eat balanced meals, accessed food or meals from a community organization or ate less because there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough money to buy food Drug and alcohol use since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 1/2 50% reported using alcohol since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, of whom 38% reported increased use of alcohol 1/4 24% reported using cannabis since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, of whom 56% reported increased use of cannabis Less than 1 in 10 4% reported using cocaine or crack, of whom 38% reported increased use 3% reported using speed, methamphetamine or crystal meth, of whom 20% reported increased use 5% reported using hallucinogens, of whom 41% reported increased use 3% reported using heroin, fentanyl or other non-medical opioids, of whom 23% reported increased use Less than 1 in 10 3% responded \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, did you access, consider accessing or want to access substance-related services (needle or syringe distribution, on-site consumption, drug checking, naloxone training and provision, etc.)?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Less than 1 in 10 5% responded \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, did you access, consider accessing or want to access substance-related treatment services (counselling, opioid substitution treatment (OST), inpatient services, community-based programs and services, etc.)?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Impact of COVID-19 on access to STBBI-related services 9 in 10 91% did not access or considered accessing STBBI prevention, testing and treatment services 1 in 10 9% accessed or considered accessing STBBI prevention, testing and treatment services Top reasons why people were not able to access STBBI-related services: Difficulty getting a referral, appointment or contacting a doctor or nurse to get information or advice Difficulty accessing service because of COVID-19 related public health measures Service was not available at time required Waited too long between booking an appointment and visit Waited too long to get healthcare service (i.e., in-office waiting) 1 in 10 10% were living with HIV at the time of the survey Less than 2 in 5 38% of those living with HIV experienced challenges accessing an HIV care provider or clinic since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Less than 1 in 10 1% reported a lifetime history of hepatitis C infection Note: The aim of this Data Blog is to provide a general snapshot of the key findings from this survey. Additional details on the various questions asked of survey participants, measured indicators, methods employed for analysis and assumptions relating to these data will be available in the forthcoming national report. Acknowledgements The success of this survey and the Data Blog was possible because of the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collaboration and partnership with several community stakeholders including community researchers, organizations and members to ensure community engagement at every step of the survey including planning and implementation. Key stakeholders include the University of Ottawa and Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health in Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hands (WHIWH) who assembled a National Expert Working Group (NEWG) to guide the implementation of the survey. The NEWG consisted of ACB researchers, service providers, and community members and leaders.

To better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected access to sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection (STBBI) prevention, testing and treatment services, and harm reduction services, for people who use drugs or alcohol, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) conducted an anonymous online survey in January and February 2021. The survey included anyone 18 years or older who was living in Canada and who identified as a person who used drugs, alcohol or cannabis in the past 6 months. In total, 1034 people from across Canada participated. 1034 participants 1/2 Just over half were under the age of 40 8 in 10 85% self-identified as White Less than 1 in 10 self-identified as: First Nations, M\u00c3\u00a9tis or Inuit (9%) or Black (3%) or South Asian (3%) 7 in 10 70% were living with family at the time of survey 1 in 5 20% were living alone at the time of survey 1 in 10 9% were living in precarious or inadequate housing Mental health and wellness 1/4 24% reported their mental health was excellent or very good at the time of survey <2/10 16% reported their mental health was poor at the time of the survey 6/10 60% reported their mental health status was worse since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 2/3 66% of those who tried to access mental health services were not always able to access these services Financial and food security 1/3 32% reported reduced hours and/or pay, or had to stop working since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 1/3 36% reported a major or moderate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ability to pay bills 4/10 42% experienced food insecurity since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Drug and alcohol use and their increased use since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 9/10 89% reported using alcohol, of whom 57% increased use of alcohol 2/3 68% reported using cannabis, of whom 61% increased use of cannabis <2/10 19% reported using cocaine or crack, of whom 45% increased use of cocaine or crack 15% reported using speed, methamphetamine, or crystal meth, of whom 52% increased use of these drugs 13% reported using opioids, of whom 57% increased use of opioids Impact of COVID-19 on access to STBBI-related services 1/2 50% of those living with HIV experienced challenges accessing a HIV care provider or clinic since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Participants reported difficulties accessing STBBI-related services: HIV testing: 50% were not always able to access Hepatitis C testing: 48% were not always able to access Other sexually transmitted infection testing: 57% were not always able to access Needle and syringe distribution programs: 58% were not always able to access Drop-in centres for people who use drugs: 84% were not always able to access Drug checking services: 83% were not always able to access Naloxone training: 50% were not always able to access Top reasons why people were not able to access STBBI-related services: Reduced hours of operation or the service was closed Difficulty getting an appointment Difficulty accessing the service because of COVID-19 related public health measures Fear of, concern about or experienced stigma, discrimination, or violence Acknowledgements This data blog update and the success of the survey would not be possible without the collaboration of the Canadian Association of People who Use Drugs (CAPUD)-led national expert working group.

Published: (2021-02-08) COVID-19 has changed how people in Canada access healthcare services. To better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ability of healthcare service providers to deliver sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection (STBBI) prevention, testing and treatment services, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) conducted a survey in November and December 2020. The anonymous survey included community-based organizations, public health units and other service providers who directly deliver STBBI-related services, including harm reduction and drug treatment services in Canada. These service providers were invited to complete an online survey about their ability to deliver, and the demand for STBBI-related healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 416 service providers from across Canada participated. Respondents were classified by the type of service they provided: STBBI prevention, testing and treatment services harm reduction services drug treatment services support and treatment for people living with HIV and/or hepatitis C Depending on the type of service that the service provider delivered, the demand for services and the ability to provide services varied. 2 of 3 66% of STBBI prevention, testing and treatment service providers experienced a decrease in demand for their services 1/2 Almost half (44%) of STBBI prevention, testing and treatment service providers experienced a decrease in their ability to deliver their services 4/10 40% of harm reduction service providers and drug treatment service providers experienced an increase in demand for their services 2 of 3 63% of harm reduction service providers and drug treatment service providers experienced no change or a slight change in their ability to deliver their services 1 in 5 21% of service providers that provide support and treatment services for people living with HIV and/or hepatitis C experienced both a decreased demand for and ability to deliver their services Service providers demonstrated resilience and innovation by developing new remote service delivery models that met the challenges created by the pandemic 4 of 5 Of all service providers, 81% provided remote services since the beginning of the pandemic. Of these, 20% created new remote services for the first time 46% created new remote services in addition to current remote services 15% continued with their existing remote services without any new services Increased demand for referrals Since the beginning of the pandemic, STBBI-related service providers, including harm reduction services, reported an increased demand for referrals related to: food security housing and/or emergency shelters health and mental health services harm reduction services Changes to staffing since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic Increases and decreases 25% of service providers reported that staffing levels decreased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and were still decreased at the time of the survey 16% of service providers reported that staffing levels increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and were still increased at the time of the survey To learn more about COVID-19, go to Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Here on the back you'll see the correct answer to the question you answered, and statistics on the answer gathered from all users who answered the question. Continue We looked at data from the last 10 to 15 years on the four major chronic diseases (heart disease and stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes) as well as mood and/or anxiety disorders. We also studied risk factors that are modifiable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or within our control to change - like smoking, eating unhealthy foods, not getting enough physical activity, being sedentary for long stretches of time and using alcohol excessively. Risk factors increase your chances of developing a disease.Risk factors are either modifiable, meaning you can change them (like a behaviour), or non-modifiable, which means they cannot be changed (like a person's genetics and age). After much number crunching, the data tell us that Canadians are generally healthy. We are living longer than our grandparents and great-grandparents and our overall health is similar to that of other developed countries. That said, many Canadians experience poor health. Chronic diseases cause 65% of the deaths in Canada each year. Although most often diagnosed in older age groups, chronic diseases could affect everyone. Here is what we found... The good news Canadians are living longer and the difference in life expectancy between men and women is decreasing. The death rate for heart disease is considerably lower than before, thanks in large part to the important decrease in the number of people who smoke. The bad news More than 1 in 5 Canadian adults lives with a major chronic disease. As well, in the past 10 years, cancer surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death in Canada. Did you know? 2.7 million Canadians are living with diabetes (types 1 and 2 combined), and that number keeps rising. 2.3 million Canadians are living with heart disease. Almost 2 million Canadians are living with a chronic respiratory disease. Between 1999 and 2009, more than 800,000 Canadians received a cancer diagnosis. There is a strong link between mental health and chronic disease: 1 in 25 Canadians over the age of 20 say they live with a mood and/or anxiety disorder and a major chronic disease. Test your knowledge Performance % Share Your Score! Let's recap Canadians are living longer, but many working\u00e2\u0080\u0093age Canadians are affected by a mood or anxiety disorder, and many live with one or more major chronic diseases. Levels of physical inactivity, sedentary behaviours and obesity continue to be high, especially in children and young adults. A health story does not start with a diagnosis; it starts much earlier. Four in five Canadian adults have at least one risk factor they can change. Positive behavior changes (like quitting smoking, being physically active, having healthy eating habits and consuming alcohol responsibly) at any age can improve overall health and well-being. Finally, being in good physical health is only part of the equation. Maintaining good mental and emotional health helps us solve problems and deal with life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenges.

These measures have been key to help curb the spread of COVID-19, but at the same time they have significantly altered Canadian families\u00e2\u0080\u0099 daily life. Disruptions in activities, school, employment and supports have had a wide range of impacts on the well-being of Canadian families, parents and children, in particular, those with greater support needs, such as children with disabilities. Using data from Statistics Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crowdsourcing questionnaire Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Parenting during the Pandemic, 2020, this data blog provides a snapshot of the experiences of parents who reported having children aged 0 to 14 years with cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities during the early response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparisons are made to the experiences of parents who reported having children in the same age range with no disabilities. Approximately 32,000 participants completed the online questionnaire between June 9 and 22, 2020 on a voluntary basis. Readers should note that data collected using crowdsourcing are not collected using a probability-based sampling design, therefore, findings cannot be generalized to the Canadian population overall. In fact, the vast majority who completed this online questionnaire were women (90.1%), born in Canada (86.4%) and post-secondary educated (94.1%). Key findings Parents with children aged 0 to 14 years with cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities reported greater concerns in a number of health and life areas compared to parents who have children in the same age range with no disabilities. Close to two-thirds of parents of children with cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities expressed concerns about their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general mental health. Compared to parents of children with no disabilities, more parents with children who have cognitive, behavioural or emotional disabilities reported they were \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerned about their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general physical and mental health (Figure 1). Parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns about their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general mental health outweighed concerns of their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general physical health with close to two-thirds of parents with children who have cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities reporting that they were \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerned about their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general mental health.

Screen time may provide children with the opportunity to engage in online learning and to socialize with friends; however, it may also be the result of a lack of other activities to occupy their time. Results showed that the vast majority of parents (about 9 in 10) reported that their children engaged in screen time at home either \u00e2\u0080\u009cdaily\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost every day\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Table 1).

Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians' Parenting During the Pandemic Public Use Microdata File. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/45250006 Half of parents with children who have cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities reported their children engaged in physical activity daily and half reported they were very or extremely concerned about their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amount of physical activity. Due to the pandemic many families have spent most of their time at home with limited to no opportunities to engage in organized sports or physical activities outside the home. Crowdsourcing data shows fewer parents with children who have cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities reported that their children engaged in physical activity \u00e2\u0080\u009cdaily\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost every day\u00e2\u0080\u009d versus parents with children who do not have disabilities (49% compared to 63%; Table 2).

The province-wide or regional lockdowns that ensued early on during the pandemic resulted in significant disruptions in children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s schooling with most having to adjust to an online learning experience. More than half of parents (58.9%) with school aged children with cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities reported that they were \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerned about their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school year and academic success, compared to 42.2% of parents with children who have no disabilities (Figure 5). Despite this, there was minimal difference in the reported frequency with which children engaged in structured academic activities at home (Table 3) and more parents with children that have cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities stated that their children received \u00e2\u0080\u009c10 or more hours of help a week\u00e2\u0080\u009d to engage in learning activities related to school (32% compared to 23%; Table 4).

Compared to parents of children with no disabilities, more parents with children who have cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities reported that they were \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerned about their family managing children's behaviours, stress levels, anxiety, emotions (Figure 6).

Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians' Parenting During the Pandemic Public Use Microdata File. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/45250006 About the participants The findings highlighted within this data blog are based on participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 self-reports of their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disability status i.e., parents with children aged 0 to 14 years who have cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities versus parents with children of the same age with no disabilities. Information about the participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 characteristics by their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disability status is summarized in Table 5. What is the Public Health Agency of Canada doing to protect people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic? The Public Health Agency of Canada has developed guidance on how to protect persons with disabilities and those that care for/support persons with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance includes strategies to minimize persons with disabilities and their carers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk of becoming infected, information on public health measures specific to persons with disabilities and advice on how to care for the physical and mental wellbeing of persons with disabilities and those that care for/support them during the pandemic. Additional information on COVID-19 and people with disabilities in Canada is available. About the data Data are from the crowdsourcing online questionnaire Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Parenting during the Pandemic, 2020. This questionnaire was designed to collect information on children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities, child care and school, parent employment status, and parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns for their family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall well-being during COVID-19 pandemic. Parents of children aged 0 to 14 years living in Canada were invited to participate on a voluntary basis. Approximately 32,000 participants completed the survey from June 9 to 22, 2020. Crowdsourcing data are not collected under a design using probability-based sampling therefore, findings based on these data are not generalizable to the overall Canadian population. However, a benchmarking factor based on demographic projections of the number of families with children aged exclusively 0 to 5 or 6 to 14 years, or a mixture of both age groups, by province/territory as of January 2020 was used for every participant to compensate for the over- or under-representation of the participants.1 Dive into the data Table 1 - Frequency with which children engaged in screen time at home Table 1.

Fewer adults reported that their mental health was excellent or very good in late 2020, compared to adults in 2019. Similarly, fewer reported that their sense of belonging to their local community was somewhat or very strong in late 2020. Both of these measures of positive mental health (\u00e2\u0080\u0098high self-rated mental health\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098high community belonging\u00e2\u0080\u0099) were even lower by early 2021. Lower average ratings of \u00e2\u0080\u0098life satisfaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099 during the pandemic were also reported. There are also signs that psychological distress has risen. The percentage of adults who had seriously contemplated suicide (\u00e2\u0080\u0098recent suicide ideation\u00e2\u0080\u0099) was higher in early 2021 than in 2019. However, significant differences in recent suicide ideation were not seen in late 2020 compared to 2019. Everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life has been disrupted by the pandemic in some way, but some people have been impacted more than others. There were inequalities in mental health outcomes before the pandemic, which may have increased during the pandemic. To better understand how mental health inequalities have changed in Canada, we conducted analyses to examine: differences in recent suicide ideation and positive mental health between sociodemographic groups: before the pandemic, using data from the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) during the pandemic, using data from the 2020 and 2021 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (SCMH) whether these differences have increased or decreased during the pandemic The findings reveal a complex picture of inequality in the mental health of adults over time. See Table 1 for an overview of the results. Highlights The magnitude of inequalities have increased for some sociodemographic characteristics, such as: Age Both before and during the pandemic, young adults (18 to 34 years) and middle-aged adults (35 to 64 years) had lower average life satisfaction than older adults (aged 65+). Young and middle-aged adults were also less likely than older adults at both time periods to have high self-rated mental health and community belonging. These differences were even larger during the pandemic. Racialized group membership Before the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among racialized adults (visible minorities and Indigenous identity) than among non-racialized adults. This difference was even larger during the pandemic. Urban/rural dwellers Before the pandemic, there was no difference in high self-rated mental health between adults living in urban areas and those living in rural areas. However, differences emerged during the pandemic, with people in urban areas less likely to have high self-rated mental health. Before the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among those living in urban areas. This difference increased during the pandemic. English and French speakers in Quebec Before the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among Anglophones than Francophones. This difference increased during the pandemic. Marital status Before the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults who had never been married compared to those who were married or living common law. This difference was even larger during the pandemic. In contrast, the magnitude of inequalities have decreased for some other sociodemographic characteristics, such as: Household income Before the pandemic, adults in low-income households were less likely to have high self-rated mental health and community belonging than those in high-income households. These differences disappeared during the pandemic. Both before and during the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults in low-income households than those in high-income households, but this difference decreased during the pandemic. Education Both before and during the pandemic, adults with a high school education or less were less likely to have high self-rated mental health compared to those with a post-secondary education. However, this difference shrunk during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults with a high school education or less, compared to those with a post-secondary education. There was no difference between these groups during the pandemic. Parents Before the pandemic, adults with children under 18 had higher average life satisfaction and were more likely to have high self-rated mental health than those without children under 18. However, these differences disappeared during the pandemic. Household composition Before the pandemic, adults living alone were less likely to have high self-rated mental health and community belonging compared to those living with others. However, these differences disappeared during the pandemic. Both before and during the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults living alone than among those living with others. This difference was smaller during the pandemic. Marital status Both before and during the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults who were separated, divorced or widowed than among those who were married or living common law. This difference shrunk during the pandemic. Summary table Table 1.

The Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health was conducted in 2020 and 2021 to better understand the self-reported mental health of adults aged 18 years and older in Canada during the pandemic, including suicidal ideation.Footnote 1,Footnote 2 Results of the survey were compared to the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. More adults in Canada reported suicidal ideation during the pandemic Before the pandemic, in 2019, 2.7% of adults in Canada reported suicidal ideation. During the pandemic, 2.4% of adults reported suicidal ideation in fall 2020. This percentage rose significantly in spring 2021 to 4.2%.Footnote 3 Some populations were more likely to report suicidal ideationFootnote 4 Sociodemographic groups Reports of suicidal ideation were: 9 times more likely among adults aged 18-34, and 4 times more likely among adults aged 35-64, compared to those 65 and over 2 times more likely among adults born in Canada, compared to landed immigrants 1.5 times more likely among adults living in urban areas, compared to those living in rural areas 1.5 times more likely among adults with secondary school education or less, compared to those with post-secondary education 1.5 more likely among adults living alone, compared to those living with others Adults who experienced pandemic-related impacts Reports of suicidal ideation were: 8 times more likely among those who experienced feelings of loneliness or isolation, compared to those who did not 7 times more likely among those who experienced feelings of emotional distress, compared to those who did not 4 times more likely among those who experienced issues with their physical health, compared to those who did not 3 times more likely among those who experienced challenges in their personal relationships, compared to those who did not 3 times more likely among those who experienced difficulties meeting their financial obligations, compared to those who did not 2 times more likely among those who experienced loss of their job or income, compared to those who did not 1.5 times more likely among those who experienced the death of family, friends, or colleagues, compared to those who did not Additionally, the likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation increased with the number of pandemic-related impacts an individual experienced. Compared to those who experienced 1 impact or less, reports of suicidal ideation were 9 times higher in those who experienced 2 or more impacts and 25 times higher in those who experienced 6 or more impacts. Adults with symptoms of mental illness Reports of suicidal ideation were: 14 times more likely among adults with moderate to severe symptoms of major depressive disorder, compared to those without 10 times more likely among adults with moderate to severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, compared to those without 8 times more likely among adults with moderate to severe symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, compared to those without Other populations Reports of suicidal ideation were: 3 times more likely among those experienced stressful/traumatic events in their lifetime, compared to those who did not 2 times more likely among those who reported increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, compared to those who did not 2 times more likely among those who reported increased cannabis use during the pandemic, compared to those who did not 2 times more likely among those who had concerns of violence in their own home, compared to those who did not 2 times more likely among those who did not exercise to improve their health, compared to those who did Although an increase in suicidal ideation was observed in spring 2021, there is currently no evidence of an increased number of deaths by suicide since the pandemic beganFootnote 5. This could change as data are updated. Monitoring changes in the population over time using surveys and administrative data can help identify groups that are at increased risk of suicide and inform suicide prevention efforts. Information about the data The two cycles of Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health were conducted by Statistics Canada from September to December 2020 and February to May 2021. Participants were asked if they had seriously contemplated suicide since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey, participants were asked if they had seriously contemplated suicide in the past 12 months. Help is available Reading about suicide may bring about difficult emotions. If you or someone you know is in immediate danger, please call 9-1-1.

Injuries and poisonings from vaping products including e-cigarettes Published: (2018-10-11) Vaping is the use of an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) or other vaping device to inhale vapour produced by heating vaping liquid or 'e-juice'. Most vaping devices have a battery, mouthpiece, heating element, and a chamber to hold vaping liquid which can contain nicotine.Footnote 1 Some people also use vaping devices to consume cannabis. Vaping has a risk of poisoning, burns and other unexpected health effects. Children have been poisoned by ingesting vaping liquid as it is often flavoured, making it more appealing; ingesting even a small amount of liquid nicotine can be serious and even life-threatening for a child.Footnote 2 There are also reports of vaping device malfunctions, such as overheating batteries causing explosions and burns. In a nationally representative sample of US hospital emergency departments, one study found 26 cases of battery-related burns from vaping devices malfunctioning, which translates to a national estimate of 1007 cases.Footnote 3 On May 23, 2018 Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA) came into effect allowing adults to legally access vaping products with nicotine.Footnote 1 Although unregulated vaping products have been available for more than a decade,Footnote 4 their manufacture, import, sale and advertisement are now subject to the TVPA as well as the Food and Drugs Act (FDA), Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA), and The Non-smoker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Act.Footnote 1 The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system currently operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 8 general hospitals across Canada. The numbers below are taken from an analysis of CHIRPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electronic database (eCHIRPP).Footnote 5 The eCHIRPP database was searched for events (or cases) related to e-cigarettes and other vaping products, which occurred on or after April 1, 2011. A detailed search was conducted of nearly 60 English and French key words in patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 descriptions of the injury event, in combination with numerical codes. Below is a snapshot of our findings. How many cases were there? There were 32 reported cases of unintentional injuries or poisonings related to vaping products including e-cigarettes (6.2 cases/100,000 eCHIRPP records) between January 2013 and August 2018. No cases were reported before 2013. The frequency of cases increased over this time period from 2.0 cases to 13.0 cases/100,000 eCHIRPP records, with an annual increase of 16.6%. Children and youth vs. adults The age range of patients injured or poisoned from e-cigarettes and other vaping products was 0 to 49 years of age. Children and youth aged 0 to 14 years were most common at 7.1 cases/100,000 eCHIRPP records, compared to patients aged 15 to 49 at 2.8 cases/100,000 records. Males vs. females Overall, 62.5% of the patients injured or poisoned were male. What types of injuries? Seventy-eight percent (78%) of the injuries reported were poisonings from ingesting vaping liquid, and 92% of those were among children aged 4 years or younger. Among all ages, nearly two-thirds (64%) of the poisoning cases specified nicotine. The remaining patients were burned from e-cigarettes exploding or catching fire (9%), or sustained another type of injury or had no injury detected (12%). Where did the injuries and poisonings happen? Most (80.6%) injuries and poisonings occurred in private residences (i.e. the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own home, or someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home). What level of in-hospital treatment was needed? More than two-thirds of patients (69%) had minor injuries or poisonings that did not require hospital admission or medical treatment, and who were therefore observed in the emergency department or received advice. Just over one-quarter (28%) of patients received medical treatment in the emergency department, and one fatality was reported. Take Note The results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all vaping-related injuries and poisonings in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Teenagers older than 18 years of age, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously being entered into the eCHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data.

CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system capturing injuries and poisonings presenting in 20 emergency departments across Canada. Every year, approximately 170,000 injury and poisoning records are entered in the database, from which information on the circumstances, types and emergency department outcomes of injuries can be examined. In this data blog, records with injuries related to sledding/tobogganing, ice skating, alpine skiing and snowboarding were examined. Sledding/tobogganing Ice skating Alpine skiing Snowboarding Sledding/tobogganing Ice skating Alpine skiing Snowboarding Sledding/tobogganing: Overall Between October 1, 2016 and January 11, 2024 there were 4,376 sledding/tobogganing-related injuries reported in the CHIRPP database, representing 556.0 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Of these injuries, the mean age was 10.0 years and males represented 54.4% of case. Among children, those aged 5 to 9 years represented nearly half of all cases at 43.6% (Table 1). Where reported, 7.5% (n = 327) of those injured stated that they were wearing safety equipment when the injury occurred.reference1 Table 1.

Last updated: 2024-05-07 Injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation continue to be a public health concern. This household item can pose a health risk to individuals, as metal bristles can detach from the brush and remain on the grill. If left unnoticed, these metal bristles can then be transferred to food and be consumed. Though rare, these injuries can result in serious health complications. The numbers presented below are an updated analysis of such injuries using the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) surveillance system. The original analyses appeared in the October 2017 issue of the Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention journal (Volume 37 No. 10). 45 emergency department visits Incidents are still being detected. Between April 1, 2011 and April 30, 2024, there were 45 reported cases of injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation, representing 2.2 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Table 1 presents the annual distribution of such injuries captured in the CHIRPP database. Table 1. Annual distribution of injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation - Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program Year Count Count per 100,000 CHIRPP records 2011 1 1.1 2012 2 1.5 2013 1 0.7 2014 1 0.7 2015 1 0.7 2016 4 2.6 2017 8 4.8 2018 4 2.1 2019 8 4.3 2020 7 4.2 2021 3 1.4 2022 4 2.2 2023 1 0.7 Findings Overall, females represented 53.3% of cases (n= 24). There were 21 cases among males (46.7%). Of the 45 cases identified, 18 cases (40.0%) sustained injuries requiring hospital admission. Injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation affect all age groups (see Table 2). Table 2.

Respiratory and digestive tract Most injuries involved a metal bristle imbedding into an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s respiratory or digestive tract. Sample Narratives The actual number of individuals who have experienced injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation is unknown, as some might seek care at facilities other than emergency departments or might not seek care at all. Sample narratives of the injuries reported to CHIRPP are listed below and are reported in the language of the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own account of events. These include: Eating burger, found barbecue brush bristle in mouth, feels like one in throat. Patient ingested some pins from the BBQ brush. Eating barbecue pork, bristle from brush used to clean barbecue got lodged at base of tongue and adenoids. Eating BBQ food; metal bristle from BBQ brush stuck on food; bristle stuck in esophagus. Had barbecued hamburger, brush bristle lodged in throat. Prevention Caution should be exercised when using metal bristle barbecue brushes due to the potential health and safety risks associated with metal bristles detaching and adhering to grills or cooked food items. To minimize the risk of issues with your metal bristle barbecue brush: regularly inspect your brush for signs of damage inspect grills and barbecued food for loose metal bristles replace metal bristle barbecue brushes every season stop using your brush if metal bristles come loose or stick to the grill consider buying a non-metal bristle barbecue brush as there are now many new alternatives being offered by retailers For more information on barbecue brush safety and recall updates, please visit Healthy Canadians. Voluntary safety standard In an effort to reduce the health risks associated with metal bristle barbecue brushes, Health Canada and the Retail Council of Canada commissioned the Standards Council of Canada to develop new national voluntary safety standards for such products. A public review of the draft safety standard was conducted in the summer of 2019 and the \"CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes\" standard was released in December 2019. The \"CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes\" standard provides requirements for the performance, testing, and marking of hand-held barbecue grill brushes with metal bristles and replacement heads. The standard specifies requirements for: wire bristle tuft attachment strength wire bristle durability replacement heads permanent on-product warning requirements requirements for instructional literature Although the \"CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes\" standard is a voluntary standard, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to monitor incidents and injuries due to metal barbecue grill brushes.

Injury in Review, 2020 Edition: Spotlight on Traumatic Brain Injuries Across the Life Course Published: (2020-08-11) This is the third report of the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (PHAC) Injury in Review series, providing national surveillance statistics on head injuries and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). The following data sources are used: Canadian Vital Statistics: Deaths Database of Statistics Canada, for reporting deaths Hospital Morbidity Database and Discharge Abstract Database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), for reporting hospitalizations National Ambulatory Care Reporting System of CIHI, for reporting emergency department (ED) visits; Electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program database (eCHIRPP) of PHAC, for reporting sentinel surveillance of ED visits Findings specific to the eCHIRPP database cover the following topics related to head injuries and TBI: Trends in TBI, 1990 to 2018 Comparisons of the five most common sports and recreational activities Male organized ice hockey Female organized ice hockey Female organized rugby Bleachers and grandstands Television tip-overs Strollers School Falls among seniors Motor vehicle pedestrian collisions Intentional injuries (self-harm and assault) Highlights Deaths Between 2002 and 2016 there were approximately 235,471 injury deaths and of those 53,200 (22.6%) were associated with a TBI diagnosis. TBI mortality rates were highest for the oldest Canadians rising sharply among those 65 years of age and older. Between 2002 and 2016, trends for males decreased slightly while female rates slightly increased. Some of the leading causes of TBI deaths were transportation collisions, falls among the elderly and suicide among males. Hospitalizations Between 2006/07 and 2017/18 there were 399,376 hospitalizations for head injuries, 63% (251,504) of which involved males. Over this period head injury trends for females showed a slight increase and for males a slight decrease. The leading cause of hospitalization for head injury was falls. Emergency Department Visits Between 2002/03 and 2017/18 there were 5,074,239 ED visits for head injuries in Ontario and Alberta combined. For both males and females, TBI ED visits have been increasing since 2009/10. Falls and sports and recreation incidents are the leading causes of ED visits for TBI. Sentinel surveillance of emergency department visits: Sentinel surveillance of TBI show similar patterns to those reported from other sources. An increasing trend in TBI for both males and females was observed over the period from 1990 to 2018. This report shows several situations where head injuries and TBI have declined over time and these declines have been linked to prevention initiatives. However, injury rates are still high and head injuries and TBI continue to be an important public health issue. As long as frequent and serious head injuries and TBI persist, the need for effective injury surveillance in support of prevention remains. Results from this report may be used to generate hypotheses for other studies, to highlight gaps in TBI/concussion surveillance and to help improve research and surveillance moving forward.

Lawn mower-related injuries Published: (2018-08-16) Mowing the lawn is a routine, three season outdoor task for many people in Canada. Despite safety recommendations and the availability of protective clothing and equipment, lawn mower-related injuries still happen to people of all ages. The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is an injury and poisoning surveillance system currently operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 7 general hospitals across Canada. The numbers below are taken from an analysis of CHIRPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electronic database (eCHIRPP). An extract of the eCHIRPP database was searched for records of unintentional lawn mower-related injuries which happened on or after April 1, 2011. These included incidents where patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 description of what went wrong contained the following key words and phrases: lawnmower, lawn mower, mowing, cutting grass, cutting the grass or cutting the lawn. The French key words and phrases were searched as well. The eCHIRPP database was also searched for records with direct cause or factor codes for unpowered, powered walk-behind or ride-on lawn mowers, and lawn mowers that were not specifically classified as powered or unpowered. How many cases were there? Between April 2011 and June 2018, there were 512 unintentional injury cases related to lawn mowers (57.0 cases/ 100,000 eCHIRPP records). More than half (54%) of the cases were reported at two of the general hospitals reporting to CHIRPP. Children and youth vs. adults Lawn mower-related injuries were more common among adults than children and youth, and most common among people aged 50 to 64 years (Figure 1). Males vs. females Overall, 75.7% of the people injured were male. How did the injuries happen? The most common circumstance of injury among all ages was the operator cutting their hand or foot (including traumatic amputation) under a mower that was turned on (Table 1). When looking at children aged 14 years and under the most common circumstance was getting burned from touching the hot motor or exhaust, at nearly a third of cases in that age group (Table 2). Top 3 most common injuries Up to three specific injuries for each case can be reported in CHIRPP, with the first being the most serious. Among the most serious, specific injuries reported, the top three most common were: Open wounds including minor cuts and lacerations (29.4%) Fractures (13.5%) Traumatic amputations, including partial amputation (11.3%), and Burn or corrosion (11.3%) Nearly all traumatic amputations (and partial) were to fingers, toes, or feet, with the exception of fewer than five cases involving the hands or lower leg (including when more than one amputation was reported). Which body parts were injured? Up to three specific body parts for each case can be reported in CHIRPP, corresponding with types of injuries reported. Among the most serious injuries reported, the top three most common body parts injured were: Finger, hand (30.4%) Toes, foot, ankle (18.3%) Head, face (including eyes), neck (16.8%) What level of in-hospital treatment was needed? Overall, 71.6% of patients received medical treatment in the emergency department, while another 14.6% of patients had injuries serious enough to be admitted to hospital for treatment. The remaining patients with less serious injuries either left without being seen by a physician, were under observation only, received advice in the emergency department about their injuries, or were admitted for a reason other than injury treatment. No fatalities were reported. Was any special safety equipment or protective clothing being used? The use of safety equipment was reported in 11.7% of cases, while another 68.6% of cases reported no use of safety equipment or protective clothing. It was unknown in the remaining 19.7% of cases. Up to five safety equipment items may be reported for each case. More than half (50.5%) of the safety equipment reported was protective boots or clothing, and another third (32.2%) was protective eyewear. Dive into the Data Figure 1. Frequency distribution of injury cases related to lawn mowers, by age group, per 100,000 records*, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2018 *Counts per 100,000 records are normalized to all eCHIRPP cases in each age to account for the uneven age distribution in the eCHIRPP database, given that there are more paediatric than general hospitals reporting to CHIRPP. Note that 369 cases in the eCHIRPP database had missing age group information. Table 1. Circumstances of lawn mower-related injury cases among all ages, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2018 *Other includes struck by a motor vehicle, flame or electrical burn, fainting, or playing with a stationary mower. Table 2. Circumstances of lawn mower-related injury cases among children and youth aged 14 and under, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2018 *Other includes: Cut/struck by component other than blades, or cut not further specified; playing with a stationary mower; fell off/ejected from a riding mower (including when overturned); injured while repairing/maintaining mower that was off; struck an obstacle (e.g., hit branch, stepped on rusty nail); lost footing/fell while operating mower; sprain/strain/awkward movement while operating mower; injured while moving/loading or unloading mower; boarding/alighting mower; flame or electrical burn. Take Note The injuries described here do not represent all lawn mower-related injuries in Canada because CHIRPP collects data at only a sample of hospitals in Canada. In addition to older teen and adults, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, because most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Because of the dynamic nature of eCHIRPP, information is still being entered into the database, so some years do not yet have complete data.

These longer-term symptoms are known as post COVID-19 condition, or long COVID. Last updated: 2024-03-01 Download page in PDF format Highlights Third report: Fall 2023 Second report: Spring 2023 First report: Fall 2022 Highlights Third report: Fall 2023 Second report: Spring 2023 First report: Fall 2022 On this page Data source Highlights of the third report (Fall 2023) Highlights of the second report (Spring 2023) Highlights of the first report (Fall 2022) Other initiatives Data source The Government of Canada developed the Canadian COVID-19 Antibody and Health Survey (CCAHS) to learn more about longer-term symptoms. The CCAHS covers the period from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until August 31, 2022. A random sample of Canadian adults were surveyed between April 1 and August 31, 2022. The questionnaire asked about new or continuing symptoms 3 or more months after a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. A follow-up survey (CCAHS-FQ) of adults who had participated in the CCAHS was conducted. The follow-up survey collected information about longer-term symptoms after confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. We used data from these surveys to produce the reports highlighted here. The first and second reports used data from the CCAHS while the third report used data from the CCAHS-FQ. Highlights of the third report (Fall 2023) The third report, Experiences of Canadians with long-term symptoms following COVID-19, was a collaboration between Statistics Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. It was published in the fall of 2023 in the journal Insights on Canadian Society. It provides information on adults who had COVID-19 and their experiences with longer-term symptoms and healthcare, as well as the vaccination status of all adults. Since this report was based on data from the CCAHS-FQ, estimates may differ from those published earlier. The survey revealed that as of June 2023: 64.4% of adults reported having had COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) and 19.8% of adults reported more than 1 infection. 19% of infected adults (3.5 million people), had longer-term symptoms. 58.2% of adults in Canada who had longer-term symptoms (2.1 million people), continued to have them. About 600,000 adults in Canada had missed time from work or school due to longer-term symptoms. On average they missed 24 days. About 100,000 adults were unable to return to work or school because of their longer-term symptoms. 66.4% of adults who sought healthcare services reported not receiving any treatment, services or support for any of their longer-term symptoms. 49.2% of all adults had received 4 or more COVID-19 vaccine doses. The survey also showed that adults who had had COVID-19 multiple times were more likely to report longer-term symptoms: 14.6% of adults with 1 infection reported longer-term symptoms compared to 37.9% of adults with 3 or more infections. Highlights of the second report (Spring 2023) The second report, Associations between Longer-term Symptoms after COVID-19 and Sociodemographics, Health Characteristics, Period of Infection, and Vaccination Status in Canadian Adults, January 2020 to August 2022, was published in the Spring of 2023. It looked at which groups of adults were more likely to report longer-term symptoms. It also explored risk and protective factors. Since this report was based on the latest CCAHS data, some estimates may differ from those published earlier. The survey revealed that 17.2% of adults experienced longer-term symptoms after having had COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected), and that certain groups were more likely to report longer-term symptoms, including those who: were female 22% of females reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 12.5% of males. had one or more pre-existing chronic conditions 37.4% of adults with 4 or more pre-existing chronic conditions reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 12.8% of adults with no chronic conditions. lived with obesity Over 27% of adults with mid to upper range obesity reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 16.2% of adults with normal weight (based on body mass index). lived with a disability 28.3% of adults with a disability reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 16.3% of adults without a disability. had more severe initial COVID-19 symptoms 44.7% of adults who were hospitalized for COVID-19 reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 2.3% of adults with no initial symptoms. The survey also showed that longer-term symptoms were more common among adults who were: infected earlier in the pandemic Over 26% of adults infected before July 2021 reported longer-term symptoms, compared to less than 15% of those infected between July 2021 and May 2022. unvaccinated 25% of adults who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vaccinated before having COVID-19 reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 13.2% of those with 2 vaccine doses and 12.2% of those with 3 vaccine doses. The results presented in this publication are consistent with other studies on longer-term symptoms after getting COVID-19. Highlights of the first report (Fall 2022) The first report, Frequency and impact of longer-term symptoms following COVID-19 in Canadian adults, was published in the Fall of 2022. 14.8% of adults with a confirmed or suspected infection experienced longer-term COVID-19 symptoms 47.3% of adults who experienced longer-term COVID-19 symptoms experienced symptoms for a year or longer 21.3% of adults who experienced longer-term COVID-19 symptoms said that their symptoms often or always limited their daily activities Longer-term symptoms were more common among females (18%) than males (11.6%), and among those who reported severe symptoms when they first got sick (36.4%). Among adults with longer-term symptoms, the most common were: fatigue, tiredness or loss of energy (72.1%) coughing (39.3%) shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (38.5%) difficulty thinking or problem solving (32.9%) general weakness (30.9%) Among adults with longer-term symptoms who were employed or attending school, approximately three-quarters (74.1%) missed some work or school due to their symptoms. On average, they missed 20 days. These results are consistent with those from other surveys and international evidence. Other initiatives about longer-term symptoms The Government of Canada is trying to better understand and address the longer-term health impacts of COVID-19. In addition to the CCAHS, other efforts include investments in research through the: Canadian Institutes of Health Research Task Force on Post COVID-19 condition For more information, please visit our post COVID-19 condition page.

While its benefits are typically thought of as reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, active transportation is also a crucial way that many Canadians achieve daily physical activity. Physical activity has many physical and mental health benefits, including chronic disease preventionFootnote 1. In 2018, Canadian adults reported using an active form of transportation for an average of 1.7 hours per weekFootnote 1. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) developed the Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour and Sleep (PASS) Indicators, consisting of 55 indicators that together help build a picture of the PASS behaviours of CanadiansFootnote 2. The PASS Indicators include several indicators related to active transportation. Evidence shows that the safer an individual feels on their cycling route, the more likely they are to cycleFootnote 3. This can be particularly true for those who are less confident cycling, and could reduce a barrier for individuals to begin cyclingFootnote 4. Bicycling infrastructure is often built to keep riders safe, but not all types of infrastructure provide equal levels of safetyFootnote 5. PHAC is currently working to develop a surveillance indicator to better understand bicycling infrastructure across the country. Open data provides one possible information source for reporting on this indicator. Open-Data Open-data refers to data that is free to access, use, modify, and shareFootnote 6. A growing number of Canadian municipalities have created open-data portals as a way to publish their data on a range of topics and make it accessible for all. These open-data datasets can be rich sources of information that can be leveraged for many uses, including public health. Datasets that include the location and types of bicycling infrastructure within municipalities are relatively common. The purpose of this investigation is to test the potential of using open-data on bicycling infrastructure to create a new PASS Indicators measure for active transportation infrastructure. Most municipalities have their own data portals, so gathering every active transportation dataset across Canada would require identifying each municipality with a portal and searching it for relevant data. As a first step in determining if such data could be used for a national indicator, this investigation explored open-data from the two largest municipalities within each Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Canada. Bicycling infrastructure data was not available for every municipality considered, indicating that there are gaps in the data. The municipalities for which data was obtained accounted for approximately 42% of the Canadian population. The nomenclature used in each dataset differed between municipalities but was kept in this tool in order to show the data as it is provided. Dive into the data Select a municipality from the list at the top of the tool to view that municipality\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrastructure. Select the toggle switch at the bottom of the tool to switch between the map view and graph view. While in the graph view hover over each bar to show the total length of each type of infrastructure and the average length infrastructure segments. Loading... Chart Map Takeaways Through this exploration of available open-data, bicycle infrastructure information was identified for 26 municipalities, accounting approximately 42% of the Canadian population. The availability and quality of this data suggests that open-data is a viable data source for the development of a measure of the amount of bicycling infrastructure across Canada. Limitations The publication date of each dataset varied by municipality, the earliest being from June 2013 and the latest from August 2018, so newbuilt infrastructure may not be reflected. From the 26 municipalities included, there were a total of 106 unique labels for bikeway infrastructure. This variation in nomenclature likely does not reflect the variation in infrastructure, and is an obstacle for cities to compare and learn from each other. Definitions for different types of bikeways varied between municipalities, so direct comparisons between cities should be considered with caution. Next steps PHAC funded the development of a simplified naming convention for bicycling infrastructure, the Canadian Bikeway Comfort and Safety (Can-BICS) classification systemFootnote 7.

Examples of mental illnessFootnote1: major depressive disorder bipolar disorder generalized anxiety disorder posttraumatic stress disorder schizophrenia eating disorders substance-related disorders Mental illness can affect anyone. Some factors have been associated with mental illness, including: family history stressful life events negative early life experiences socio-economic status Early care and seeking treatment can help individuals recover from or manage a mental illness. However, stigma and other barriers can delay people from seeking help. Mental illnesses have a significant impact on the health of Canadians as well as the Canadian economy, including our health and social care systems. 1 in 3 1 in 3 Canadians (about 9.1 million people) will be affected by a mental illness during their lifetimeFootnote 2. According to the most recent findings from the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS)Footnote 3: 1 in 7 Every year, about 15% of Canadians use health services for a mental illness. 5.5 million Close to 5.5 million Canadians received health services for a mental illness in 2016-2017. That's more than the population of British Columbia. Female vs. Male Canadian females are 30% more likely than males to use health services for mental illness. Young Canadians In 2016-2017, Canadians aged 19 and under had the lowest proportion of health services use for a mental illness (10.7%). However, there is an increasing trend in the use of health services for mental illness among young Canadians. From 2000-2001 to 2016-2017, the proportion of Canadians aged 19 and under using these services rose an average of 2.6 % per year. The Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) is updated annually and is supported by a pan-Canadian partnership between the Public Health Agency of Canada and all provinces and territories.

Overview and user guide Dashboard Understanding the data Overview and user guide Dashboard Understanding the data On this page Methodology Definitions How we use the data Disclaimer Methodology Site Selection We selected sampling sites for the pilot program based on various considerations, with a focus on: sites previously sampled for pesticides or other water parameters sites located in areas of intensive agriculture suggesting high pesticide use sites with previous detections of pesticides sites that could be easily accessed Sampling All samples were collected as grab samples, which provide a snapshot of water quality at the exact time and place the sample was taken. Samples were collected twice weekly during the growing season at most sites, and less frequently at others. Samples during the winter months were collected only at select locations. Laboratory Health Canada developed a liquid chromatography (LC) method to measure pesticides in water. We considered all pesticides that are currently registered for outdoor use in Canada. The LC method can measure 185 current-use pesticides (and 2 transformation products) which represent approximately 75% of the pesticides used outdoors. Additional pesticides and transformation products may be added in the future. The University of Guelph's Agriculture & Food Laboratory analyzed a subset of these samples for 5 other current-use pesticides and 6 other transformation products. We now have data for 190 pesticides and 8 transformation products. For the full list and applicable analytical limits, visit the Open Data portal. Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) Currently, neither this dashboard nor the Open Data site includes QA/QC samples, such as duplicates, field and trip blanks. Supporting data Other field data (such as probe, field conditions and environmental conditions) were collected, when possible, during sample collection. These data are not presented on this dashboard. However, the following parameters are available in Open Data: pH salinity turbidity conductivity redox potential dissolved oxygen water temperature total dissolved solids Definitions Glossary of terms for environmental water monitoring for pesticides How we use the data The Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) will use the data generated during this pilot program, along with all other relevant datasets, in risk assessments for pesticide registration (approvals) and re-evaluation. Other relevant datasets can include data generated by other federal departments, provinces and territories, researchers and pesticide companies. Some Canadian pesticide data are available to the public online. A few examples include: Quebec: Water Atlas Prince Edward Island: Monitoring for Pesticides in Drinking Water Ontario: Pesticide Concentrations in Stream Water Saskatchewan: Primary Station Water Quality; River Basin Water Quality Environment and Climate Change Canada: National Water Quality Pesticides Surveillance Data The PMRA closely reviews the data from the pilot program to identify any potential risks to human health or aquatic life. If found, the PMRA will take action to reduce these risks. We compare the concentrations of pesticides in water samples to the HHRVs and ALRVs. When the concentration of a pesticide in water is at or below the HHRV and ALRV, no harm is expected to occur to human health or aquatic life. If the concentration of a pesticide is above the HHRV or ALRV, we determine whether that specific site or pesticide requires further investigation. Other federal and provincial departments may also develop thresholds or use other reference values to protect aquatic life. They may have different risk management goals and use different methods. As a result, their thresholds may not be the same as the PMRA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ALRVs.

Mood & Anxiety Disorders in Canada Published: (2016-06-28) Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common types of mental illnesses, and they affect Canadians of all ages. So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference? Mood disorders are characterized by the lowering or elevation of a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mood and include major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder and perinatal/postpartum depression. Anxiety disorders include excessive and constant feelings of nervousness, anxiety and even fear. They include generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, among others. Although mood and anxiety disorders are distinct, one person will often experience both. Each of these disorders can have a major impact on a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life and as a result, are a significant public health challenge in Canada. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why The Public Health Agency of Canada works with provinces, territories and national organizations to monitor and report on the burden, the wide ranging impacts, and the trends of these disorders in order to better inform prevention efforts and health care services in Canada. Here are some of our findings: 1 in 10 More than 1 in 10 Canadians aged 18+ report having a mood and/or anxiety disorder. [SLCDC, 2014] 3.5 million Every year, close to 3.5 million Canadians use health services for mood and/or anxiety disorders, of which 258,000 are children and youth (1-19 years). [CCDSS, 2016] 3/4 Roughly three-quarters of Canadians who use health services for a mental illness in a given year use them for mood and/or anxiety disorders. [CCDSS, 2016] x2 Mood and anxiety disorders are more common among women than men. [O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell et al, 2015] 30-54 years old The age group that uses health services for mood and/or anxiety disorders the most is middle-aged Canadian adults (30-54 years), followed by older adults (55 years and older). [CCDSS, 2016] 35% Over one-third of working Canadians diagnosed with a mood and/or anxiety disorder(s) say they had to stop work at some point because of their disorder(s). [SLCDC, 2014] 65% Family doctors are the most consulted health professional for mood and anxiety disorders (65%) followed by non-physician health professionals (35%), including psychologists and social workers, counselors, psychotherapists.

Surveillance counts may vary from those on provincial or territorial websites. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll update our data as our reporting partners share new information with us. Clinical cases, asymptomatic cases and severe outcomes Clinical cases of WNV can present with symptoms that range from mild to severe. Asymptomatic cases are those in which the patient has no symptoms and has typically been identified through routine testing of donated blood. Clinical cases neurological non-neurological unspecified clinical Asymptomatic cases Deaths About these data tiles Cases are classified using the clinical and lab criteria in the WNV national case definition. Deaths are determined at the local or provincial or territorial level, so there may be differences in how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re classified or investigated. A case that meets both the lab and the clinical criteria may be classified as: West Nile neurological syndrome: The patient has severe disease that affects the central nervous system (for example, dangerous inflammation of the brain or spinal cord) West Nile non-neurological syndrome: The patient has less severe or flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, headache or nausea West Nile unspecified: The patient meets clinical criteria but no classification has been specified A case that meets the lab criteria but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet any of the clinical criteria is classified as a West Nile asymptomatic infection. A case is recorded as a death when WNV was a direct or contributing cause of the death. Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) No cases of EEEV in horses have been reported. No EEEV infections in humans have been reported. California serogroup viruses (CSGV) No CSGV positive mosquito pools have been reported. 1 CSGV infection in humans has been reported.

As unique as these births are, they also face more challenges: higher risk of premature birth, low birth weight and neonatal death (meaning death before a child is one month old). Due to a greater risk of abnormal cognitive development and learning disabilities, multiple birth newborns require careful neuro-developmental follow-ups.

Obesity in Canadian Adults: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s About More Than Just Weight Published: (2017-04-25) Obesity is at epidemic levels around the world in both children and adults. Although adult obesity in Canada has been relatively steady since 2004, the percentage of adults who are obese today is twice as high as it was in 1978-1979, from 13.8% Footnote 1 to 28.2% (Table 2). This is concerning since obesity is a known risk factor for chronic diseases like diabetes or hypertension. When are people considered obese? People are considered obese if they have too much fat on their body that can negatively affect their health. This is usually measured using the Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight in kilograms by their height in metres, squared. A BMI of 30 kg/m Footnote 2 or higher is considered obese for adults aged 18 and over. A BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m Footnote 2 is considered overweight. But like health, developing obesity is a complex process influenced by different factors. Biology (like sex or genetic make-up), behaviours (like physical activity and diet), as well as mental health are important factors. In addition, where someone lives, their income, social relationships and personal identity can all influence behaviour and mental state and thus, also play an important role. So with this in mind, what are the numbers telling us about obesity in adults? Demographic Factors Over the past decade, when comparing men and women, there has been little to no difference in obesity between them. For both, the percentage of people that are obese has remained more or less unchanged. While obesity rates increase with age, it seems to level off around middle-age (Table 1). Income adequacy takes into account the number of people living in a household and the amount of income available to support them. Some of the factors that contribute to obesity (like diet, sleep, mental health and well-being, etc.) are impacted by income level (Table 2 and Table 3). While the overall rate of obesity among Canadian adults is 28.2%, it can vary a lot based on where someone lives (e.g. health region) [see map]. Lifestyle Factors Eating Behaviours Canadian adults think their eating habits are \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery good\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the majority of them eat their main meal at the family table (92.4%; CCHS 2012 Food Skills Rapid Response). However, most adults do not use the Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Guide when doing their grocery shopping (69.5%; CCHS 2012 Food Skills Rapid Response) yet many have habits that help them make healthy choices. For instance, most use a grocery list (73.2%) or read nutrition labels (63.3%) [CCHS 2012 Food Skills Rapid Response]. In general, normal weight adults eat healthier (41.7%) than those who are obese (34.2%) [Table 2]. That said, only 39.3% of Canadian adults actually maintain a healthy diet (Table 2). Current health advice suggests that drinking fewer sugary drinks is part of a healthy lifestyle that contributes to a healthier weight Footnote 2. Although only a small percent of adults (12.8%) say they drink one or more sugar-sweetened drinks per day, specifically regular soft drinks, sports drinks or fruit-flavoured drinks (Table 2), the sales of new sugary drinks like energy drinks, flavoured waters, and sweetened coffees have increased dramatically in Canada with sweetened coffees alone increasing 579% between 2004 and 2015 Footnote 3. Drinking sugar-sweetened drinks is higher among younger adult Canadians but this decreases with age (Table 2). Activity Behaviours Being physically active is important to health, yet only 22.2% of Canadian adults are active enough (Table 2). In fact, the majority of Canadians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 waking hours (9.8 hours per day) are spent on activities that are sedentary (which means that they require very little movement) such as sitting at a desk or watching television (Table 2). Only a small percentage of adults take active forms of transportation, like walking or cycling, to get to and from their workplace (19.8% walk and 4.1% bike; CCHS 2014). Over the past few decades, as the amount of sleep adults get has gone down (from 8.0 hours per night in 1992 Footnote 4 to 7.2 hours per night in 2013-2014; Table 2), obesity has gone up Footnote 5. Current research shows that 64.5% of Canadian adults do get adequate sleep Footnote 6, but this can vary by age group (Table 2). Psychosocial Factors A person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental state and social relationships can play a part in the development of obesity, but can also be affected by excess weight Footnote 7, Footnote 8. At all ages, there is widespread discrimination towards those considered obese Footnote 6. Binge eating, which can cause weight gain, has been linked with depression and lower self-esteem, and is often used as a way of coping with stress Footnote 8. Among Canadian adults, a higher number of obese adults report being depressed or having a mood disorder (11.0%) compared to overweight (7.0%) or normal weight (6.9%) adults (Table 3). Your identity is how you see yourself, your appearance, abilities and uniqueness. Obesity can have an impact on this. Obese adults report feeling happy less often (93.0%) and are less likely to report being in very good or excellent health (45.1%) than adults who are not obese (95.1% and 68.3%) [Table 3]. However, when looking at a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outlook on life, both normal weight and obese adults report similar feelings about their sense of community (62.4% and 58.1%) and that they had trusting relationships (95.7% and 95.4%) (Table 3). Interestingly, a higher number of overweight adults report feeling a sense of community (71.1%) and that they had trusting relationships (96.3%) compared to obese or normal weight adults (Table 3).

Last updated: 2024-03-27 Key findings Maps Graphs Technical notes Key findings Maps Graphs Technical notes On this page Context Key updates Reports summary Deaths Hospitalizations Emergency department visits Emergency medical services Acknowledgments Suggested citation Context Canada has seen substantially elevated numbers of opioid-related deaths and other harms since national surveillance began in 2016 by the Public Health Agency of Canada. This public health crisis is having a tragic impact on people who use substances, their families, and communities across the country, and is shaped by a wide range of factors. The COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated the crisis, as several jurisdictions reported higher rates of fatal overdoses and other harms following the onset of the pandemic. Presented here are the most recent available data on opioid and stimulant-related overdoses and deaths in Canada, where available. For more details on additional studies and other products related to the overdose crisis, refer to the Data, surveillance and research page. Key updates Reported so far in in Canada {Deaths} Apparent opioid toxicity deathsFootnote 1Footnote 2 (%% higher than same period in 2022) {Deaths per day} Deaths per day {Hospitalizations} Opioid-related poisoning hospitalizationsFootnote 3 (%% higher than same period in 2022) {Hospitalizations per day} Hospitalizations per day {ED visits} Opioid-related poisoning Emergency Department (ED) visitsFootnote 4 (%% higher than same period in 2022) {ED visits per day} ED visits per day {Emergency Medical Services (EMS) responses} Emergency Medical Services (EMS) responses to suspected opioid-related overdosesFootnote 5Footnote 6 (%% higher than same period in 2022) {EMS responses per day} EMS responses per day Report summary Deaths There was a total of 42,494 apparent opioid toxicity deaths reported between January 2016 and September 2023. So far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), most (88%) of the accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths in Canada occurred in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Males accounted for 72% of accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), while those aged 20 to 59 years accounted for 88%. Of all accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 82% involved fentanyl. This percentage has increased by 44% since 2016 when national surveillance began but appears to have stabilized in recent years. Of all accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 82% involved opioids that were only non-pharmaceuticalFootnote 7Footnote 8. Of all accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 57% also involved a stimulant. Hospitalizations There were 41,045 reported opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations from January 2016 to September 2023, where 65% were accidental poisonings. Most accidental opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations occurred among males (91%) and among individuals aged 30 to 39 years (24%) so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September). Among the 4,646 opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 18% involved co-poisoning with a stimulant. Fentanyl and its analogues were involved in 32% of opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September). The percentage of all opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations that involved fentanyl and its analogues has increased 100% since 2018 when national surveillance began, but appears to have stabilized in recent years. Among the 1,795 stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 46% involved co-poisoning with an opioid. Emergency department visits There were 169,723 reported opioid-related poisoning emergency department visits from January 2016 to September 2023 Footnote 4. Among these, 77% were accidental opioid-related emergency department visit Footnote 9. Most opioid-related poisoning emergency department visits occurred among males (68%) and among individuals aged 20 to 49 years (74%) so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September)Footnote 4. Of opioid-related poisoning emergency department visits so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 8% involved co-poisoning with a stimulantFootnote 9. Fentanyl and its analogues were involved in 44% of opioid-related poisoning emergency department visits so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September)Footnote 9. The percentage of all opioid-related poisoning emergency department visits that involved fentanyl and its analogues has increased 120% since 2018 when national surveillance began, but appears to have stabilized in recent years. Of stimulant-related poisoning emergency department visits so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 32% involved co-poisoning with opioids (including fentanyl or fentanyl analogues)Footnote 9. Emergency medical services Of the EMS responses for suspected opioid-related overdoses so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September), 70% were among malesFootnote 5. The majority of EMS responses for suspected opioid-related overdoses so far in 2023 (January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September) were among those aged 20 to 49 years; however, variations are apparent between provinces and territoriesFootnote 5.

Osteoporosis Awareness Month \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Exposing The Bone ThiefPublished: (2015-12-07) Osteoporosis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the bone thief \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a common bone disease and with the aging Canadian population, the number of people affected is expected to increase. It occurs when the loss of bone tissue is faster than normal, causing it to become weak and break (fracture) easily. Often people are not aware they have osteoporosis until they have a fracture. The most common areas for fractures include the wrist, shoulder, spine, pelvis and hip, with hip fractures being the most serious. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) works with partners and provides information about osteoporosis to help Canadians understand the importance of avoiding the bone thief and building strong bones for life. Visit the Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website to learn more. 2.1 million About 2.1 million (or 12% of) Canadians who are 40 years and older have received a diagnosis of osteoporosis. [PHAC] 5x Women 40 years of age and older are five times more likely than men to be diagnosed with osteoporosis. [PHAC] 150 per 100,000 annually Each year there are about 150 hip fractures per 100,000 Canadians 40 years of age and older. [PHAC] 31% Almost one third (31%) of the people who have suffered a hip fracture die within the following year. Interestingly, there is a significant difference between the mortality rate of men and women. While 28% of women who have suffered a hip fracture die within the following year, 37% of men suffer the same fate. [Jiang HX et al., 2005] < 1/2 Getting enough calcium and vitamin D through diet or supplements, as well as regular exercise are recommended for the prevention of osteoporosis. However, among Canadians 40 years of age and older, less than half reported taking both calcium and vitamin D supplements (32%) and engaging in regular physical activity (43%). [PHAC] < 20% Despite the high rate of fragility fractures in the Canadian population, less than 20% undergo diagnosis or receive treatment for osteoporosis. Men are less likely than women to receive an intervention. [Bessette L et al., 2008] [Leslie WD et al., 2012] 80% vs 15% A fracture is to osteoporosis what a heart attack is to cardiovascular disease. The care gap is far greater after a fracture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about 80% receive beta blockers (that slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure) to help prevent recurrent heart attack, compared to 15% that receive an anti-osteoporosis medication following a fragility fracture.

Parkinson Disease Published: (2022-04-26) What is it? Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder. It results from the progressive loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that carries signals between nerves in the brain and controls the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements. Decreasing amounts of dopamine to the brain can lead to the four main motor symptoms of Parkinson disease: Shaking Muscle stiffness Slow movement Difficulty with balance and posture Individuals living with this disease may also experience various non-motor symptoms. [Parkinson Canada, 2022] In collaboration with all Canadian provinces and territories, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) collects, analyzes and shares data on diagnosed parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS). This information aids the planning and evaluation of health policies, programs and services. Who is affected? Around 91,000 The number of Canadians aged 40 years and older living with diagnosed parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, in 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017. [CCDSS, 2021] Over 1.5X Adjusting for age, parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, is over 1.5 times more common in men than in women. [CCDSS, 2021] Over 11,000 The number of Canadians aged 40 years and older newly diagnosed with parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, in 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017. [CCDSS, 2021] What are the health impacts? 23% Almost a quarter of Canadians with Parkinson disease also report living with a mood disorder. [Mapping Connections, 2014] 43% Approximately 43% of Canadians aged less than 65 years living with Parkinson disease are permanently unable to work. [Mapping Connections, 2014] 1/2 About half of all Canadians living with Parkinson disease report mobility limitations. [Mapping Connections, 2014] There is currently no cure for Parkinson disease, but treatments are available to help mitigate its symptoms and health impacts.

Note: Unless otherwise stated, the data includes women from age 15-54 (CIHI) or age 15-55 (CCHS) who gave birth during a specified time period. a Data from CCHS is self-reported.b Age-specific, birth rates for mothers: The denominators for the age-specific rate of live births were population estimates for the corresponding age category for the specific calendar year.c Severe Maternal Morbidities: The 14 categorized types include: Severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome; Postpartum hemorrhage with RBC transfusion or procedures to the uterus or hysterectomy; Maternal ICU admission; Hysterectomy; Complications of obstetric surgery and procedures; Repair of bladder, urethra or intestine; Puerperal sepsis; Assisted Ventilation through endotracheal tube; Cardiac Conditions Curettage with RBC transfusion; Acute Renal Failure; Eclampsia; Obstetric Shock; Placenta previa with hemorrhage with RBC transfusion.d Total births include live births and stillbirths.e Preterm Birth Rate: This indicator is defined as the number of live births with a gestational age at birth of less than 37 completed weeks (<259 days), expressed as a proportion of all live births. Limitation of data on preterm birth is error in reporting of gestational age, particularly when it is based on menstrual dates. These errors have diminished in recent decades as ultrasound confirmation of gestational age is widely used across Canada; however, dating ultrasounds performed in the first trimester are more accurate than in the second trimester. f SGA and LGA: The small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birth rates are defined as the number of live births for which birth weight is below the 10th percentile, or above the 90th percentile, respectively, for sex-specific birth weight for gestational age, expressed as a proportion of all singleton live births.g Fetal Mortality Rate: This indicator is defined as the number of stillbirths, per 1000 total births (live births and stillbirths), and is recorded through CIHI to include all registered stillbirths (no evidence of life upon birth). Those requiring registration (in all provinces or territories, excluding Quebec) include stillbirths following pregnancy termination, with a birth weight \u2265500 g or a gestational age at delivery \u226520 weeks.h Crude infant mortality rates are calculated from all births weighing at least 500g, and includes neonatal and postneonatal deaths. Infant Mortality Rate: This indicator is defined as the number of deaths of live born babies in the first year after birth per 1,000 live births. Infant deaths can be subdivided into neonatal deaths (0\u201327 days) and postneonatal deaths (28\u2013364 days).

        "content": "Poisonings and injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure: data blog: A summary of statistics highlighting unintentional poisonings and injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure. Last updated: 2023-08-24 This data blog presents statistics on unintentional poisonings and injuries related to carbon monoxide (CO) exposures captured in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) between April 1, 2011 and June 15, 2023. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system capturing injuries and poisonings presenting in 21 emergency departments across Canada. Every year, approximately 170,000 injury and poisoning records are entered in the database, from which information, such as the circumstances and types of injuries can be examined. This data blog then concludes by providing important prevention safety measures to reduce the risks of being exposed to CO. What is carbon monoxide poisoning? CO poisoning is a significant public health concern in Canada responsible for an estimated 300 deaths and 200 hospitalizations each yearFootnote 1. Considered as a leading cause of unintentional poisoning deaths in CanadaFootnote 2, CO is a poisonous gas that is undetectable by our senses because it has no smell, no colour and no taste; this makes it difficult to recognize its presence and emphasizes the importance of installing CO alarms in indoor spaces. Characteristics of carbon monoxide: No smell No colour No taste How is carbon monoxide produced? CO is produced when hydrocarbon fuels such as charcoal, wood, gasoline, natural gas or propane are burned incompletely. The poor maintenance, installation and ventilation of fuel burning appliances and equipment, such as fireplaces, gas ovens and generators can lead to the dangerous buildup of CO gas in indoor spaces, including kitchens, garages and living rooms. Common sources of carbon monoxide includeFootnote 3: Indoor cooking and household appliances (gas ranges, woodstoves, gas washers and dryers) Outdoor appliances (barbecues, gas lamps, camping stoves) Nonelectric combustion based heating systems (furnaces, gas water heaters, fuel burning space heaters, fireplaces) Gas-powered tools (chain saws, compressors, lawn mowers, snowblowers) Gas powered portable generators Idling vehicles with combustion engines (car, motorcycle, ATV, snowmobile) Tobacco smoke Fire Be aware of the symptoms of CO poisoningFootnote 4Footnote 5: The early signs of mild to moderate CO poisoning are similar to the flu or food poisoning (except no fever), and some common symptoms include: Headache Shortness of breath Fatigue Dizziness Nausea Higher levels of CO poisoning can, however, lead to worse and life-threatening symptoms, including: Vomiting Loss of consciousness Coma Death Carbon monoxide-related cases in CHIRPP As presented in Table 1, between April 1, 2011 and June 15, 2023, there were 767 unintentional CO-related events reported in the CHIRPP database, representing 42.6 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Of these events, the mean age was 17.5 years; males represented 55.1% of cases (n = 423), and children aged 0 to 4 years represented the highest percentage among age groups at 24.3% (n = 184). Nearly two-third of cases (63.6%) occurred during the colder seasons of Canada: fall and winter. Work-related incidents involving CO exposure accounted for 10.6% of cases (n = 81). There were 150 incidents that resulted in two or more patients presenting in the emergency departments \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these incidents involved 458 patients in total. Table 1. Characteristics of carbon monoxide-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to June 15, 2023: Table 1. Characteristics of carbon monoxide-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to June 15, 2023.

Emergency department presentations and outcomes Among all cases, poisoning and asphyxia/threat to breathing were the most common emergency department presentations at 85.7% (n = 655). Of note, among 12.1% of cases (n = 93), no injuries or poisonings were detected following assessments at the emergency departments. In terms of outcomes, the majority of patients required observations and treatments in the emergency departments at 37.1% and 31.9%, respectively. Approximately 6.9% of patients were admitted to the hospital (Table 2). Table 2. Characteristics of carbon monoxide-related emergency department presentation in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to June 15, 2023: Table 2.

Among the 49 reports, 43 described events in Canada. These reports also noted 34 instances of reported fatalities and 15 reported injuries related to CO poisoning. The top 3 product categories reported include: Kitchen appliances (n = 15) Heating and cooling appliances (n = 13) Generators (n = 12) Additionally, there are approximately 150 possible cases of CO poisoning reported from media sources. Due to limited information available in these reports, involvement of CO poisoning is suspected but could not be confirmed and location will vary. Prevention: Reduce the risks of carbon monoxide exposure CO poisoning is preventable. Below are some important safety measures that may help reduce the risks of being exposed to CO: Safety characteristics and specific guidance that may help reduce the risks of being exposed to CO: Safety item/characteristic Guidance and recommendations Carbon monoxide alarms Install CO alarms that are certified to meet Canadian safety standards on every level of your home, especially closer to sleeping areas. Be sure to test them regularly and replace the batteries as recommended by the manufacturer. Fuel-burning appliances Make sure all fuel-burning appliances are properly installed, maintained, and vented to the outside. Keep vents and chimneys clear of debris and snow, and never block them. Ventilation should not recycle air back into the room. Maintenance of fuel-burning appliances Maintain and inspect fuel-burning appliances including furnaces, boilers, water heaters, gas stoves and fireplaces by a qualified technician annually to ensure proper functioning. Fuel-burning appliances and enclosed spaces Never use a portable fuel-burning appliance, such as a camping stove, generator, or charcoal grill indoors or in an enclosed space, such as a garage, basement, tent or camper. Motor vehicles and gas-powered equipment Never run a motor vehicle or gas-powered equipment inside a garage attached to your house even if the garage door is left open. Know the symptoms Be attentive to possible symptoms of CO poisoning, particularly if multiple household members are experiencing similar symptoms. Take Action: What to do if you suspect CO exposure Evacuate the property immediately and move to an area with fresh air. Call 9-1-1 without delay. Do not go back inside. Wait for the approval of emergency services responders before re-entering the premises. Limitations The results presented above do not represent all CO-related injuries and poisonings in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, M\u00c3\u00a9tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years may not have complete data. References Footnote 1 Cohen I, Garis L, Rajabali F, Pike I.

In 2012, the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention Act became legislation in Canada and led to the development of the 2016 Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention. The Framework is focused on raising awareness and reducing stigma, better connecting people to information and resources, and accelerating innovation and research to prevent suicide. In light of the Framework, the Public Health Agency of Canada championed the dissemination of statistics on suicide and related risk factors through the development of the Suicide Surveillance Indicator Framework (SSIF). In June 2019, the SSIF was updated and released on the Public Health Infobase, an online interactive data tool.

Radon Action Month in Canada Published: (2019-11-21) November is Radon Action Month. There is no better time to start testing your home and ensuring that the air you breathe is safe for you and your family. What is radon and where can I find it? Radon is an invisible radioactive gas that causes lung cancer. In Canada, it is the second highest cause of lung cancer, after smoking. It comes from the ground and is produced by the breakdown of the mineral uranium that occurs naturally in the soil. As uranium breaks down, it eventually releases radon. Radon is a gas, so it travels easily through the soil, working its way toward the surface. When radon escapes into outdoor air, the concentrations are low (approximately 15 Bq/m3). However, radon also escapes into our homes wherever they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in contact with the soil, finding its way in through cracks or around pipes and drains. Here in Canada, our homes are well sealed to keep us warm in the winter, and so the radon concentration in our homes can easily build up. Canada is one of several countries with high levels of radon. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and the Yukon are regions within the country that have radon levels that are comparable to some of the highest levels around the world, such as in the Czech Republic, Finland, Mexico and Sweden. However, every region in Canada has homes with elevated radon, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthwhile testing your home. The percentage of homes with high radon levels are presented in the map below, developed by Colin Gutcher and the radon technical operations group at the Radiation Protection Bureau. Description The percentage of homes with high radon levels in City of Ottawa Health Unit is 7%. In Canada, radon is the second highest cause of lung cancer, after smoking. November is Radon Action Month - there is no better time to start testing your home and ensuring that the air you breathe is safe for you and your family. This map was created using data collected from the Cross-Canada Radon Survey (2011) and the Radon Thoron Survey in Canadian Metropolitan Areas (2013). Collected information is grouped by Health Region. Boundary files are sourced from Statistics Canada, 2018. Map produced by Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada, 2019. *A high radon level is defined as a radon level that is greater than the Health Canada guidelines for indoor radon, 200 Bq/m3. Download the data (.csv) Download the map (.png) How do you find out the radon level in your home? Simple: test your home. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re located or what the levels are in your neighbours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 homes. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter whether your home is old or new, small or large. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that some communities have higher than average radon levels, each house is different and high radon levels can be found anywhere. If you do detect radon in your home, contact a certified radon professional to determine the most effective way to manage the issue. What is the benefit of removing radon from homes? The big benefit is to help prevent lung cancer. More than 3,000 lung cancer deaths are attributable to radon in Canada each year, and removing radon from homes can reduce that number. Dr. Janet Gaskin, an epidemiologist at Health Canada, has conducted research to assess the risk from radon in homes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRadon mitigation is easy to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Gaskin. For example, installing radon preventive measures in new homes reduces radon entry. According to estimates, 453 fewer lung cancer deaths could be prevented every year in Canada if all new homes included radon reduction systems. If high levels of radon are measured in existing homes, a very effective technique called an active soil depressurization system can reduce radon by about 90%, and this would prevent even more lung cancer deaths every year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately, lung cancer is still characterized by low survival rates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reminds Dr. Gaskin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cResearch suggests that radon prevention in new housing is very cost effective in every region of Canada and that testing and mitigation of high levels in existing housing is cost effective in higher radon regions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Testing your home for radon is easy to do and all homeowners are encouraged to test the radon level in their homes and to take action to reduce it if the level is high. After all, it could save lives! Report a problem or mistake on this page Date modified: 2019-11-21"

Radon risk: Raising awareness to encourage action Published: (2020-11-26) Radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer among non-smokers in Canada. Raising public awareness is a critical first step toward protecting Canadians from the health risks associated with long-term exposure to high radon levels. Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Radon Program (NRP) was established to educate the Canadian public, providing knowledge and resources to take action on radon. By increasing awareness, we can accelerate the reduction of radon in homes and other indoor spaces, reducing the risk of radon-induced lung cancer. Although Canadians are more aware of radon, there is still much work to be done. According to the Statistics Canada Household and Environment Survey, radon testing rates in Canadian households have only reached between 5% and 10% depending on the region. In addition, the 2015 Residential Radon Mitigation Actions Follow-Up study found that more than 70% of households with test results above the Canadian guideline of 200 Bq/m3 had not taken action to reduce their high radon level. Encouraging households nationwide to test and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if necessary \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reduce their radon exposure is a priority of the National Radon Program. Increasing awareness among Canadians In 2020, the NRP decided to evaluate the impact of an outreach postcard, created to inform and encourage people to purchase a radon test kit. The goal was to answer two important questions: Does a behaviourally informed postcard increase awareness, and will this awareness translate to action? The radon action postcard was designed to present a simple, direct message about the hazard of radon gas, and clear, action-oriented steps to provide a behavioural nudge to motivate purchasing a test kit and putting it to use. They were distributed to Canadian households in areas where more than 14.49% of homes tested above the Canadian guideline of 200 Bq/m3. Health Canada was then able to measure postcard impact, by tracking the number of test kits sold during the 8-week period, collecting data from the call centre, and monitoring website traffic. What we found The study found that a targeted postcard does increase awareness, with a more substantial impact among communities with existing local radon awareness and engagement. Website visits to Canada.ca/radon from individuals living in targeted regions increased by over 4,000%, and TakeActiononRadon.ca saw an increase of more than 1,200%. Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call centre also saw a significant spike in calls compared to the same period the previous year. While there was also an uptick in the number of test kits purchased, the impact was not comparable to the increase in web traffic. This study showed that the postcards do not adequately increase the behaviour of purchasing a radon test. Moving forward, these results demonstrate the need for further solutions that focus on the importance of testing. New strategies are required to motivate action. Click on the image to learn more about the postcard. Next steps Based on these findings, the NRP is proposing the addition of a coupon code, redeemable for a free radon test kit, to be included in future postcard mail outs. In combination with the postcards, ongoing awareness raising activities will help reinforce messaging and encourage action on this very important health issue. Testing for radon is easy.

Evidence indicates that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks of the disease. Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the provinces and territories, and manufacturers continue to closely monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll respond to any safety issues right away and will inform Canadians about any risks that arise in Canada. Of the individual reports ( of all doses administered), were considered serious ( of all doses administered). A total of 105,016,456 vaccine doses have been administered in Canada as of December 3 2023, including 5,694,993 of XBB.1.5 vaccines and 9,948,907 bivalent vaccines. Among all adverse events reports: 1,044 were following bivalent vaccines, of which 783 were considered non-serious (0.008% of bivalent vaccine doses administered) and 261 (0.003% of bivalent vaccine doses administered) were considered serious. 278 were following XBB.1.5 vaccines, of which 251 were considered non-serious (0.004% of XBB.1.5 vaccine doses administered) and 27 (0.0005% of XBB.1.5 vaccine doses administered) were considered serious. On July 26, 2023, Health Canada cancelled the Drug Identification Number (DIN) for JCOVDEN (previously Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) at the request of the manufacturer pursuant of the Food and Drug Regulations. On December 19, 2023, Health Canada cancelled the DIN of Vaxzevria previously (Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine) at the request of the manufacturer pursuant of the Food and Drug Regulations. How to report an adverse event If you experience an adverse event following immunization with a COVID-19 vaccine in Canada, please contact your healthcare provider. Learn more about reporting adverse events. Reporting trends The information on this page reflects detailed case information data from the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS) and Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canada Vigilance program. Doses administered used for reporting rate calculations have been adjusted to account for the delay between vaccination and reporting. The data on this page may undergo changes as more information about cases becomes available. There have been a total of reports (55.9 reports per 100,000 doses administered) up to and including . Of the reports, were considered serious (11.1 reports per 100,000 doses administered). Overall, the rate of serious reports has remained low. Figure 1 below shows the number and rate of COVID-19 adverse event reports by reporting period, as well as the cumulative number of reports. Figure 1.

As of December 3, 2023, some jurisdictions are only submitting data on doses administered for XBB.1.5 vaccines. A minimum 5-week reporting lag period is used to account for time lags between someone experiencing an adverse event since vaccine administration and the event being reported to CAEFISS or Canada Vigilance. To align the numerator and denominator for rate calculations, we restrict reports to those with a date vaccine administered as of December 3, 2023. This change is due to changes in the provincial and territorial reporting frequency of data on doses administered, and ongoing data improvement initiatives. Although the cumulative number of adverse event reports continues to increase over time, so does the number of doses administered. Up to and including MMM DD, 2021 all adverse event reports represented 0.056% of all doses administered. The shaded area represents a period of time (lag time) where there may be delays in receiving and processing reporting forms. There may also be delays in receiving data on doses administered. Information on doses administered by age group was only available starting April 23, 2021 for those aged 12 and older, starting November 27, 2021 for those aged 5 to 11 years, and starting July 17, 2022 for those under the age of 5. Rates of adverse event reports and doses administered by age group are not reported before these dates.

Adverse event following immunization reports by vaccine name Figure 2 shows the breakdown of reports by vaccine name. For doses administered by vaccine type, please visit the vaccination coverage report. Higher rates of non-serious adverse event reports are observed for each vaccine. Serious report rates remain low. Currently, rates of adverse event reports following the first dose are higher than after subsequent doses. The data for subsequent doses do not take into account which vaccine an individual received for previous doses. Generally, non-serious adverse event reports are consistent with information provided in the vaccine product pages. A total of 105,016,456 vaccine doses have been administered in Canada as of MMM DD, 2021, including 5,694,993 vaccine doses with the XBB.1.5 strain and 9,948,907 bivalent doses. Among all adverse event reports: 1,044 were following bivalent vaccines, of which 783 were considered non-serious (0.008% of bivalent vaccine doses administered) and 261 (0.003% of bivalent vaccine doses administered) were considered serious. 278 were following XBB.1.5 vaccines, of which 251 were considered non-serious (0.004% of XBB.1.5 vaccine doses administered) and 27 (0.0005% of XBB.1.5 vaccine doses administered) were considered serious. 544 of the 58,712 COVID-19 adverse event reports (0.93%), involved people who received an influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine on the same day. These events have been closely monitored, and no new safety concerns have been identified. Figure 2.

Adverse event following immunization reports by age and sex Age differences The rate of adverse event reports was highest among the 40 to 49 year age group (84.6 reports per 100,000 doses administered), followed by those in the 30 to 39 year age group (72.3 reports per 100,000 doses administered). The rate of adverse event reports was lowest in the 5 to 11 year age group. Sex differences Overall, most adverse event reports were from females (72.4%). The reporting rate for females was 75.9 reports per 100,000 doses administered, compared to 31.5 per 100,000 doses administered for males. However, within the youngest age groups (<18 years of age) the reporting rate is similar in males and females, or slightly higher in males. This may be due to differences in health care seeking behaviour (for example, reporting adverse events) as well as biological differences between females and males. The higher proportion and rate of adverse event reports for females has been observed in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and other countries. Health Canada, PHAC, and provincial and territorial public health authorities will continue to monitor but have not identified this as a safety issue. Figure 3.

Adverse events of special interest, safety signals, and deaths Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are pre-specified medically significant events that have the potential to be causally associated with a vaccine product. They must be carefully monitored and confirmed by further special studies. AESI can be serious or non-serious and can include: events of interest due to their association with COVID-19 infection. events of interest for vaccines in general (e.g. to the specific vaccine type or adjuvants). The list of AESIs below takes into consideration the lists of AESIs from these expert groups, manufacturers and regulatory authorities: Brighton Collaboration Vaccine COVID-19 Monitoring Readiness protocol The AESI list changes based on the evolving safety profile of vaccines. Although adverse events may occur after being vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, they are not necessarily related to the vaccine. Health Canada and PHAC review the reports to determine whether the vaccine may have played a role. Up to and including , the most commonly reported AESI was myocarditis/pericarditis (Table 1). To align with standard reporting practices, for AESIs with a Brighton Collaboration case definition (BCCD), only those meeting the BCCD level of certainty 1 to 3 are reported. BCCD level 4 AESIs (indicating not enough information to confirm the diagnosis) are not included in the number of reports and rate calculations for the table below. Table 1.

AESI Category AESI Total Notes 1 Includes adverse events meeting levels 1-3 of the Brighton Collaboration level of diagnostic certainty. 2 COVID-19 vaccines that are currently authorized in Canada cannot cause an infection because they do not contain the live virus. While they are all highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19 illness and death, no vaccine is 100% effective, and some COVID-19 cases will still occur. For vaccines that have a two-dose regimen, protection begins 14 days after the first dose, and 7 to 14 days after the second dose. 3 WHO guidance on pregnancy related AESIs. An asterisk (*) indicates a vaccine product that is no longer authorized. As of December 3, 2023, some jurisdictions are only submitting data on doses administered for XBB.1.5 vaccines. Please note that 1 report represents 1 person and may contain information on more than 1 adverse event of special interest. A minimum 5-week reporting lag period is used to account for time lags between someone experiencing an adverse event since vaccine administration and the event being reported to CAEFISS or Canada Vigilance. To align the numerator and denominator for rate calculations, we restrict reports to those with a date vaccine administered as of June 18, 2023. This change is due to changes in the provincial and territorial reporting frequency of data on doses administered, and ongoing data improvement initiatives. Safety signals identified and other safety updates To date, 2 safety signals have been confirmed: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) and myocarditis/pericarditis. This is based on adverse events that were reported in Canada during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which followed their detection internationally. These reports do not imply a causal relationship between the vaccines and the adverse event. Health Canada updated the respective product monographs to include information about these adverse events. Health Canada PHAC will continue to monitor these events. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is characterized as blood clotting with low platelet levels. Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), also known as Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), is characterized as TTS that seems to be vaccine-induced due to the laboratory-confirmed presence of platelet factor (PF) 4 antibodies. Numbers and rates were adjusted following receipt of additional information by the Advisory Committee on Causality Assessment (ACCA). Up to and including June 25, 2021, 89 reports of TTS have been reported that met level 1 to 3 of the Brighton Collaboration level of diagnostic certainty. Of the TTS reports: 56 reports followed vaccination with the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccine 24 followed vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine 8 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine name for 1 was not specified. For detailed information on the results of expert causality assessment for a subset of TTS reports, please visit the ACCA webpage. Myocarditis/pericarditis Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the lining around the heart. Up to and including June 25, 2021, there were 1,231 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis that met levels 1 to 3 of the Brighton Collaboration level of diagnostic certainty. Of the myocarditis/pericarditis reports: 725 reports followed vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine 465 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine 18 followed vaccination with the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccine 5 followed vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) bivalent vaccine 4 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax (Original/Omicron BA.1) bivalent vaccine 3 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax XBB.1.5 vaccine 1 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax (Original/Omicron BA.4/5) bivalent vaccine 1 followed vaccination with the Janssen JCOVDEN vaccine 1 followed vaccination with the Novavax Nuvaxovid vaccine the vaccine name for 8 were not specified The reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine is higher than that of the Pfizer BioNtech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine. Among the 725 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine (administered to those 5 years of age and older): symptoms started between 1 minute and 155 days after vaccination median age is 26 years (age range 6 to 88 years old) 474 were males [median age 21 years (age range 7 to 86 years old)], 243 were females [median age 39 years (age range 6 to 88 years old)], the sex of 2 were 'other', and the sex of 6 were not specified 286 reports followed the first vaccine dose, 392 reports followed the second vaccine dose, 41 reports followed the third vaccine dose, 5 reports followed the fourth dose, and the dose number for 1 was not specified current analyses show the number of reports of myocarditis/pericarditis following the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine is higher than what would be expected in the general population of males and females less than 30 years old and primarily following the second dose Among the 465 reports of myocarditis following vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine (administered to those 6 months of age and older): symptoms started between 5 minutes and 113 days after vaccination median age is 29 years (age range 14 to 95 years old) 339 were males [median age 27 years (age range 14 to 95 years old)], 122 were females [median age 36 years (age range 18 to 88)], the sex of 1 was 'other', and the sex of 3 were not specified 86 reports followed the first vaccine dose, 336 reports followed the second vaccine dose, 36 reports followed the third dose, 6 reports followed the fourth dose, and the dose number for 1 was not specified current analyses show the number of reports of myocarditis/pericarditis following the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine is higher than what would be expected in the general population, particularly among males and females less than 40 years old and following the second dose Evidence is evolving and investigations into the association between myocarditis/pericarditis and mRNA vaccines continue. Deaths Up to and including June 25, 2021, a total of 488 reports with an outcome of death were reported following vaccination. Although these deaths occurred after being vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, they are not necessarily related to the vaccine. Medical case review previously used the WHO-UMC causality assessment categories to classify the status of death reports. Updated WHO guidance on causality assessment specific to vaccinations has been released. This updated user guide more accurately represents causality assessments following vaccination, so all reports with an outcome of death were updated and reclassified using the new classification system. Of the 488 death reports, it was not possible to assess causality for 131 reports due to missing information (not enough information to initiate causality assessment). Preliminary causality assessment was possible for the remaining 357 cases where there was sufficient information. Using the available information and the WHO guidance on causality assessment specific to vaccinations, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve determined that: 167 reports of death were unclassifiable due to lack of available information (not enough information to complete the preliminary assessment) 109 reports of death were inconsistent with causal association to the vaccine (unlikely to be linked to the vaccine) 77 reports of death were indeterminate (insufficient definitive evidence or conflicting evidence for causality) 4 deaths were consistent with causal association to immunization (see ACCA webpage) If additional information becomes available, cases will be re-assessed, and the causality assessment may be updated. Acknowledgements This quarterly report would not be possible without the collaboration of federal, provincial and territorial public health partners as well as everyone taking part in the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Canada. We would also like to thank everyone who took the time to submit an adverse event report for their contribution to vaccine safety in Canada. Suggested citation Public Health Agency of Canada.

Schizophrenia in Canada Published: (2020-07-07) What is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that affects about 1% of Canadians Footnote 1. Affecting the way a person interacts with and understands the world, key symptoms of active schizophrenia include: Footnote 2 Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech and/or behaviour Impaired cognitive ability The severity, duration and frequency of these symptoms can cause social and occupational challenges Footnote 3. The cause and course of schizophrenia are unique for each person, which make it difficult to identify the exact cause of the condition. Genetics, along with structural changes in the brain, combined with lifestyle and environmental factors, are some of the identified factors that may play a role Footnote 4 Footnote 5 Footnote 6 Footnote 7 Footnote 8 Footnote 9 Footnote 10 Footnote 11 Footnote 12 Footnote 13 Footnote 14 Footnote 15 Footnote 16 Footnote 17 Footnote 18. While there is no cure for schizophrenia, programs and treatments are available to help manage symptoms in the community and at work. Reducing public misunderstanding and fear of the disease can reduce stigma and support affected individuals Footnote 3. Using national data from 2016-2017Footnote 1 How many Canadians live with schizophrenia? 1 in 100 About 1% of Canadians aged 10+ live with diagnosed schizophrenia. 50 per 100,000 About 50 per 100,000 Canadians are newly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Profile of schizophrenia in Canada Men vs women Schizophrenia affects more men (56%) than women (44%) during their lifetime. Younger population About 3 out of 10 newly reported cases of schizophrenia occur between 20 to 34 years of age Among this group, men were twice as likely to be diagnosed than women In general, men experience an earlier onset of schizophrenia than women Use of health services for schizophrenia Over 147,500 Canadians aged 1+ used health services for schizophrenia. Among this group, usage was more common in men (60%) than women (40%). Have rates of schizophrenia changed over time? Between 2002 and 2016, the number of Canadians living with diagnosed schizophrenia increased by an average of 3% per year. The number of new cases declined during this period Footnote 1 Footnote 19. In 2016-2017, the all-cause mortality* rate in people diagnosed with schizophrenia was 2.8 times higher than those without.* The age-standardized rate of death from any cause among individuals with and without schizophrenia.

Sedentary Behaviour in Children and Youth: A New Health Risk Published: (2016-04-26) Did you know? Activities that require very little movement, that involve sitting or reclining, are called sedentary behaviours. Among children, common sedentary behaviours include sitting while watching TV, playing on the computer or iPad, or texting. Excessive time spent being sedentary is linked to poor health in children and youth, no matter how active they are. More and more, evidence is suggesting that it is not just physical activity that impacts how healthy you are, but also what you do during down-time. Encouraging children and youth to give up even small amounts of screen-based activities each day in exchange for physical activities of any kind can make an important difference in their health and well-being. Sedentary behaviour and physical activity are just two of the eight behavioural risk and protective factors included in the Chronic Disease and Injury Indicator Framework, which is updated annually. 8.5 hours Excluding sleeping hours, Canadian youth (17 and under) spend on average 8.5 hours daily being sedentary. [PHAC] 9.3 vs 7.6 hours Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 are more sedentary than children aged 5 to 11 by almost 2 hours daily. (9.3 versus 7.6 hours per day). [PHAC] 72% 72% of children and youth (age 5-17) spend more than 2 hours per day watching television or using computers during their leisure-time. This exceeds the \u00e2\u0080\u008eCanadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines, which recommend no more than 2 hours of screen time per day. [PHAC] 9.3% Only 9.3% of children and youth (ages 5-17) meet the recommended Physical Activity Guidelines of doing at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day.

This data blog is the first within a series presenting statistics on substance use-related injuries and poisonings reported by the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program. This first data blog synthesizes key findings from recent and forthcoming surveillance studies based on analyses of the eCHIRPP. Subsequent data blogs will present near-real time eCHIRPP statistics on a variety of substances at regular intervals throughout 2020-2021. Opioids Context: Between January 2016 and December 2019 there were more than 15,300 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada, and 72% of deaths involved one or more types of non-opioid substancesFootnote 1. Many fatal overdoses result from the illegal drug supply containing highly toxic synthetic opioids like fentanyl and fentanyl analogueFootnote 2. Between January 2016 and December 2019, 19,377 opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations occurred in Canada (excluding Quebec)Footnote 1. There is little evidence that the crisis is abating. More information on the actions taken by the Government of Canada to address the opioid crisis can be found under Federal Actions on Opioids-OverviewFootnote 3. What we know from a CHIRPP study Footnote 4 on opioids : Between March 2011 and June 2017, 583 suspected opioid-related poisoning/injury cases were identified in eCHIRPP. Recreational use of opioids was most common among adults. Compared to all types of injuries reported in the eCHIRPP database, opioid-related cases were more likely to: be among females be self-harm have occurred at home or in a residential institution have occurred between 12:00 a.m. and 7:59 a.m. have resulted in observation in the emergency room have resulted in a hospital admission. The most common factor contributing to opioid-related poisoning among young children (aged <5 years) was access to medication combined with lack of supervision (e.g. an unsupervised child found pills). Suicide attempt accounted for the largest proportion of cases in youth aged 10 to 19 years (33%), followed by older adults aged 50 years and older (28%) and adults aged 20 to 49 years (9%). Methamphetamine Context: Use of methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant that can have harmful effects on the central nervous systemFootnote 5Footnote 6, is also an emerging public health issue alongside the opioids overdose crisis. There has been an increase in the availability, use and harms associated with methamphetamine use across Canada in the last 10 yearsFootnote 7. What we know from a CHIRPP studyFootnote 5on methamphetamine : Between April 1, 2011 and August 9, 2019, 1,093 patients (97.6 per 100,000 eCHIRPP cases) with methamphetamine-related injuries and poisonings were identified in eCHIRPP. Of these, 649 (59.4%) were male. Among those aged 10 to 14 and 15 to 19 years, females accounted for the majority of cases (71.4% and 63.7%, respectively). Of those aged 20 years and older, males accounted for 70.4% of cases. Just over a third of cases (n=404, 37%) involved methamphetamine use on its own. Of the 689 cases where additional substances were involved, 40.9% involved using two or more other substances with methamphetamine. When only one other substance was used with methamphetamine, the distribution was: alcohol (24.4%) cannabis (10.7%) cocaine (7.7%) heroin (5.4%) opiates (3.6%) other substances (e.g. LSD, ecstasy, psychoactive medications) (7.3%) Among the 1,093 patients identified, there were a total of 1,389 injuries and poisonings (27.1% had multiple injuries). Multiple injuries occurred more frequently in males (32.8% vs. 18.7% for females; p <.001) More poisonings were seen in female patients (71% vs. 57.4% for males; p <.001) Multiple injuries were seen more frequently in male patients (32.8% vs. 18.7% for females; p <.001). Cannabis Context: The prevalence of cannabis use has increased in Canada in recent decades, including since the legalization of non-medical cannabis use in 2018Footnote 8. Cannabis edible products and concentrates have been legal for sale in Canada as of October 17, 2019Footnote 9. Adverse health outcomes of cannabis use are known to include fatal and non-fatal injuries from motor vehicle collisions involving cannabis-related impairmentFootnote 10; acute ingestions among children causing altered levels of consciousness and other symptomsFootnote 11; and in adults, gastrointestinal ailments, intoxication and psychiatric symptoms, among othersFootnote 12. What we know from a CHIRPP studyFootnote 8 on cannabis: Between April 1, 2011 and August 9, 2019, there were 2,823 cannabis-related cases reported in eCHIRPP (252.3 cases per 100,000 eCHIRPP cases). Nearly two-thirds of these (63.1%) involved cannabis in combination with one or more other substances (polysubstance use). Approximately one-third of cases involved cannabis alone (31.3%), and cannabis edibles were reported among 5.6% of cases. Cases ranged from 0 to 79 years of age. Children \u00e2\u0089\u00a417 years of age represented the majority (67.8%) of cannabis-related cases. For all cannabis categories combined (cannabis alone, polysubstance use, and edibles), males represented a higher proportion of cases across all age groups with the exception of females aged 10 to 14 years, who were near equal to males at 50.3%. Significant increases in annual percent change (APC) were identified in the study period. Overall, there was a 30.1% APC between 2015 and 2018. A 27.9% annual percent change (APC) was noted among adults between 2013 and 2018, and among children there was a 35.6% APC between 2016 and 2018. E-cigarettes and vaping substances Context: Vaping is the use of an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) or similar device to inhale vapour produced by heating vaping liquid or 'e-juice' which can contain nicotineFootnote 13Footnote 14 and/or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)Footnote 14. Research has also shown e-cigarettes are being used by some to deliver other substances such as methamphetamine and heroinFootnote 15Footnote 16. Prevalence of vaping has also been on the rise in Canada in recent years. It is more prevalent in youth than adults aged 25 and over, and prevalence among youth has increasedFootnote 17Footnote 18Footnote 19. One study reported the prevalence of vaping among adolescents aged 16 to 19 years, nearly doubled between 2017 and 2018Footnote 19. Since the emergence of electronic cigarettes on the Canadian market in 2018 there have been new injuriesFootnote 20. Children have been poisoned by ingesting vaping liquid as it is often flavouredFootnote 21Footnote 22Footnote 23, and packaging of e-liquids also look very similar to snacks for children, increasing their appealFootnote 24.There are also reports of vaping device malfunctions such as overheating batteries causing explosions and burnsFootnote 22. More recently, vaping-associated lung illness has emerged as a new public health threatFootnote 25. What we know from a CHIRPP studyFootnote 22 on e-cigarettes and vaping : Between April 1, 2011 and October 4, 2019, there were 68 cases of injury or poisoning related to e-cigarette use or vaping reported in eCHIRPP. Of these cases, 37 (54.4%) were males. Just over half of the cases (52.9%) were children under the age of five who either inhaled from the device or ingested the vaping liquid. Two adults were injured/burned when the battery of their e-cigarette exploded in their pockets. There were three reported traumatic brain injuries resulting from falls that occurred after vaping. More than half of the cases (n=35, 51.5%) occurred in 2018 and 2019. Between 2013 and 2019, there was an annual percent change (APC) of 50.7% (95% CI: 15.9\u00e2\u0080\u009396.1). More about the data source CHIRPP is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system currently operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and nine general hospitals across CanadaFootnote 26Footnote 27. It collects patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts of pre-event injury circumstances (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and clinical information is added to the data collection form by hospital staffFootnote 26Footnote 27. The CHIRPPcaptures a more complete picture of the injury event than hospital administrative or mortality data alone, and also identifies less serious injury cases that do not require hospitalizationFootnote 27. The results from CHIRPP presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all substance use-related injuries and poisonings in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Teenagers older than 18 years of age, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously being entered into the eCHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data.

Health Canada defines a serious adverse drug reaction as: \"A noxious and unintended response to a drug, which occurs at any dose and requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, causes congenital malformation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is life-threatening or results in death.\" Food and Drug Regulations Suspected health product The reporter suspects that the health product caused the adverse reaction. Cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. Data source The reports included in this summary are available in the Canada Vigilance database for health products and medical devices. The database is updated monthly to include reports received up to 90 days before the posting date. Health Canada uses this 90-day period to review the new reports submitted, code the information and perform quality assurance activities. Data limitations There may be reactions or incidents that we've received but haven't yet entered into the database. Some important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization. However, they may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to prevent more serious outcomes. These events may also be considered serious. A report can contain more than 1 reaction or incident. Some reports may be missing information. Population size estimates were calculated using the most recent and reliable information available at Statistics Canada. Approximations and rounding were applied to the data when defining these groups, so these numbers are estimates. The true size of these populations may be larger or smaller, which could affect reporting rate estimates. Data from the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon are too small to display for confidentiality reasons. More details on the limitations of the Canada Vigilance data can be found in the instructions for the Canada Vigilance database. Date modified: 2023-03-23"

Sport and Recreation-related Concussions and Other Traumatic Brain Injuries Among Canada's Children and Youth Published: (2018-10-11) Sports and recreational activities have many social and health benefits and are therefore an important part of the lives of many children and youth in Canada.It's also important to play smart and play safe to minimize the risk of injury. Concussions and other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are more common in some sports and recreation-related activities than others, and can range from mild to severe. A concussion is a form of mild traumatic brain injury, and usually happens because of a hit to the head, neck, face or another part of the body, causing the brain to move inside the skull and become injuredFootnote 1. The short- and long-term consequences of concussion and other TBI can be severe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially for children and youth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although concussion signs and symptoms usually resolve within 10 days to four weeks, and children and youth often take longer to recover than adults Footnote 1. Dive into the Data What do the graphs and tables show? These tools are interactive snapshots of statistics about sports and recreation-related concussions and other TBIs among Canada's children and youth aged 5 to 19 years. The information is from the electronic database of the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) for the years 2011 to 2017. The bar graph shows sports and recreation-related TBIs compared to all other injuries for your selected age group and sex. Use the \"Switch to\" button to toggle between the number of TBIs and the percentage of TBIs. Hover-over or tab to a specific sport/activity in the interactive bar graph to view more information. The bee swarm graph shows the percentage (%) of concussions and other TBIs for your selected age group and sex, compared to all sports and recreation-related injuries among all age groups and both sexes combined, i.e. how your selection fits into the \"bigger picture\". Use the drop-down lists to change the graphs to look at: Results for specific age groups Results for males vs. females The data tables show: The data that were used to create the bar graph and bee swarm The breakdown of all TBIs in two subcategories: concussions and non-concussion TBIs Traumatic brain injuries compared to all injuries in a given sport among males females aged 5 to 9 10 to 14 15 to 19 (eCHIRPP, 2011-2017) TBIs account for 43.4% of ice hockey incidents reported to eCHIRPP (or 630 injuries) among males aged 5 to 9. Switch to Percentages Data tables with concussion breakdown The tables below contain all of the data in the beeswarm and bar graph. They also include a breakdown of all traumatic brain injuries in two subcategories: concussions and other TBI's. Table 1. Number and percentage of sports and recreation-related concussions and other TBIs, males aged 5 to 9 years, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2017 Table 2.

Number and percentage of sports and recreation-related concussions and other TBIs, males aged 15 to 19 years, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2017 Table 6. Number and percentage of sports and recreation-related concussions and other TBIs, females aged 15 to 19 years, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2017 Results Highlights On average, concussions make up 93% of the sports and recreation-related TBIs among children and youth that are reported to CHIRPP. Overall, contact sports were the most common sports and recreation-related activities with reported concussions or other TBIs, for both sexes and in all age groups. Ice hockey was the most common sports and recreation-related activity with reported concussions or other TBIs among males aged 5 to 14 years, but rugby was the most common for the older males. Ringette was the most common sports and recreation-related activity with reported concussions or other TBIs among females aged 10 to 19. It is also worth noting that among females in all age groups shown, equestrian sport/horseback riding was also among the most common non-contact sport with reported concussions or other TBIs. Sledding/tobogganing was among the most common sports and recreation-related activities with reported concussions or other TBIs for children aged 5 to 9 years (3rd most common after ice hockey and physical education class among boys, and 2nd after ice hockey among girls). All-terrain vehicle (ATV) use was the leading cause of moderate to more severe TBIs** (i.e., showed the lowest percentage of concussions among all TBIs) among almost all children and youth, with the exception of females aged 5 to 9 (for whom it was equestrian sport/horseback riding, see Table 2,) and males ages 10 to 14 (for whom it was baseball, see Table 3). Take Note How were these statistics calculated? The percentage (% ) of concussions and other TBIs among all injuries for a given SPAR-related activity is calculated like this: ( Number of concussions* and other TBIs** for a given sports and recreation-related activity Number of all injuries for a given sports and recreation-related activity ) \u00d7 100 * The number of concussions includes both concussions and subconcussive impacts/undiagnosed concussion (minor closed head injury). In the eCHIRPP database, concussion is classified as Nature of Injury code 41 Minor closed head injury and 42 Concussion. ** TBIs include subconcussive impacts, undiagnosed concussions, diagnosed concussions, other more serious intracranial injuries, as well as skull and facial fractures and crushing injuries. In the eCHIRPP database, TBI is classified as either Nature of Injury code 41 Minor head injury, 42 Concussion, or 43 Intracranial injury; in eCHIRPP TBI is also classified as follows: Body Part 110 Head including scalp, skull, or Body Part 120 Face, combined with Nature of Injury code 12 Fracture, or Nature of Injury code 18 Crushing injury. Limitations The results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all sports and recreation-related injuries in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Teenagers older than 18 years of age, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously being entered into the eCHIRPP database; therefore some years do not yet have complete data. More information and related material Learn more about concussions.

CNISP conducts prospective surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistant organisms (AROs) to inform evidence-based policies and control measures against antimicrobial resistance (AMR). CNISP collaborates with sentinel hospitals across the country to collect epidemiologic and microbiology data on HAIs and AROs. Over the years, CNISP has significantly expanded, and it now conducts surveillance on 12 different pathogens in 106 hospitals across 10 provinces and 1 territory. In addition to monitoring HAIs and AROs, CNISP also collects and analyzes data on antimicrobial use, infection prevention and control practices, laboratory practices, viral respiratory illnesses including COVID-19, and emerging threats such as Candida auris. Additional information on CNISP can be found in our overview publication: The Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program: Keeping an eye on antimicrobial resistance in Canadian hospitals since 1995 NEW Simplified Dataset (SDS) In 2022, CNISP launched the Simplified Dataset (SDS), which allows hospitals outside of the CNISP network to contribute aggregate data to CNISP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rates. This project is currently being piloted with Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) with plans to expand to other HAIs and AROs. By combining patient-level data from participating CNISP hospitals and aggregate data from the SDS, CNISP will have a more representative sample of Canadian hospitals, enabling the program to report national and regional rates of AMR with greater accuracy. With almost 100 hospitals actively participating in SDS surveillance, CNISP is rapidly expanding its representativeness across Canada. CNISP is actively recruiting hospitals to participate in the SDS.

Toy-Related Injuries Published: (2022-12-15) While toys provide entertainment and fun, they can also cause or contribute to injuries, some serious, among children and youth. The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is a sentinel surveillance system that collects injury and poisoning data from the emergency departments of 11 pediatric and 9 general hospitals across Canada. What we know about toy-related injuries from CHIRPP How were cases identified? The information below shows the toy-related injuriesFootnote i among children and youth aged 17 and under from CHIRPP for the last 10 years (April 1, 2011 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 November 9, 2022). Toy-related injuries by age and sex Between April 1, 2011 and November 9, 2022 there were 29,268 cases of toy-related injuries, with 63% occurring in males and 37% in females (n = 18,537 and n = 10,731 respectively). The number of toy-related injuries by age group are as follows: less than 1 year (n = 1,012, 3.5%) 1 to 4 years (n = 13,298, 45.4%) 5 to 9 years (n = 8,590, 29.3%) 10 to 17 years (n = 6,368, 21.8%) What types of toys caused the most injuries? Table 1 presents the most common toy categories that were associated with the largest number of injuries by age group where the toy category was known (n = 21,217). Information on the specific toy is not always provided to the emergency department or recorded by them. This occurred in 27.5% (n = 8,051) of the cases. Table 1. Toy categories associated with the largest number of injuries by age group, CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to November 9, 2022 Age group Toy category Number of cases Percent* Less than 1 year Riding toys 56 16.4% Toy cars or toy trucks 43 12.6% Building sets 40 11.7% Toy chests and boxes 29 8.5% Blocks, stacking toys and pull toys 26 7.6% 1 to 4 years Riding toys 1,111 14.2% Building sets 974 12.5% Toy cars or toy trucks 932 12.0% Scooters 733 9.4% Balls 572 7.3% 5 to 9 years Scooters 3,141 44.6% Balls 886 12.6% Building sets 489 6.9% Toy sports equipment 385 5.5% Toy weapons and projectile toys 276 3.9% 10 to 17 years Scooters 3,965 65.8% Balls 900 14.9% Toy weapons and projectile toys 204 3.4% Flying toys, including kites, Frisbees, boomerang 189 3.1% Toy sports equipment 181 3.0% *Excludes n = 8,051 cases where the toy type was not specified. Percentages are calculated among each age group and do not add up to 100% as only the top five toy categories for each age group are listed. Within the less than 1 year age group, just under 20% of cases occurred among infants less than 6 months of age. What were the most common toy-related injuries? Overall, open wound injuries (23.5%) were the most frequent toy-related injury, followed by fractures (19.0%) and bruises/abrasions or soft tissue injuries (16.2%). The most frequent types of injuries varied by age group: Less than 1 year: Traumatic brain injuries at 29.1%, followed by foreign body injuriesFootnote ii at 16.0%. 1 to 4 years: Open wounds at 32.3%, followed by foreign body injuries at 17.1%. 5 to 17 years: Fractures at 28.7%, followed by bruises/abrasions or soft tissue injuries at 19.8%. How did the toy-related injuries happen? The 4 most common mechanisms of toy-related injuries were: Falls, including tripping over toy (n = 17,272, 59.0%) Struck by/against objects (n = 6,249, 21.4%) Foreign body entering into or through a natural orifice, including eye, ear, nose, and genitourinary tract (n = 2,012, 6.9%) Ingestion or inhalation/aspiration of foreign body, except food (n = 1,736, 5.9%) What percentage of cases were admitted to hospital? Hospital admission was required for 2.6% of toy-related injury cases (n = 773), of which the majority were hospitalized for fractures (55.0%). Other injuries requiring hospital admission included foreign body in the alimentary tract (11.8%), foreign body in the respiratory tract (6.7%) and traumatic brain injury (5.2%). What types of injuries occurred from certain toys? Injuries related to children's wagons (n = 499) most frequently included traumatic brain injury (31.9%) and fracture (21.0%). The majority of the time (82.2%) these injuries were due to falls from the wagon. Foreign body injuries were the most frequent nature of injury caused by small toys or toy parts including marbles, building sets, modelling compounds, magnetic sets, board games, battery-operated toys and balloons. Examples of foreign body injuries include those of the alimentary tract, respiratory tract, nose, ear canal, external eye or genitourinary tract. Of the 1,418 riding toy-related injuries, open wound (29.5%) was the most frequent injury, followed by traumatic brain injury (21.4%) and fracture (17.8%). Riding-toy related injuries often occurred due to falling off the riding toy (85.1%). Fracture (40.0%), bruises/abrasions or soft tissue injury (23.0%) and open wound (14.8%) represented the majority of all scooter-related injuries (n = 7,842). Falling (89.1%) while scootering was the most common mechanism of injury. The majority of injuries related to toy weapons and projectile toys (n = 591) were eye injuries (36.7%) and open wounds (30.1%), largely from being struck by or against an object (81.9%). Open wound (32.3%), traumatic brain injury (19.0%), and fracture (16.8%) were the most frequent children's tricycle-related injuries (n = 607). These injuries often occurred from falling off the tricycle (79.7%). Prevention and safety tips Below are tips on ways to prevent toy-related injuries from occurringreference 1 Make sure to choose age-appropriate toys. Toys for older children may contain small parts or present other hazards that make them unsafe for younger children. Check that the toy is sturdy, well made and in good condition. Make sure to read toy instructions and ensure children are using toys how they were intended to be used. Do not give young children toys with small parts/accessories. Do not give children novelty magnet sets. Make sure that batteries are securely contained in the toy and that they are not accessible to the child. Be careful with button batteries, as they can result in significant injury or death if swallowed. Make sure any riding toys you buy are appropriate for your child's size, age and abilities.

CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, M\u00c3\u00a9tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. References Health Canada. Is Your Child Safe? Play Time [Internet].

Last updated: 2023-08-24 We live our days in a 24-hour cycle. Most of that time is spent in intervals of physical activity, sedentary behaviour (like sitting and screen time) and sleep. The Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour, and Sleep (PASS) Indicators, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in 2017, track indicators that highlight these different components of daily activity. This framework reports on a range of indicators and measures focused on individual behaviours, the social environment and the built environment and gives an overall picture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chow active Canadians are\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The 2023 edition of the PASS Indicators provides access to 61 unique indicators among children/youth and adults, this information can be used to develop evidence-based policies and programs for a healthy and active Canadian population. Physical activity Canadian adults ages 18 years and older should accumulate 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week to achieve optimum health benefits and protect against chronic diseases.Footnote 1 About half (49.2%) of Canadian adults get the recommended amount of physical activity each week. Similarly, only 43.9% of Canadian children and youth get the recommended amount of physical activity per day. For optimal health benefits, Canadian children and youth ages 5 to 17 years should accumulate an average of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per day.Footnote 2 Sedentary behaviour On average, Canadian adults spend 9.6 hours of their day sedentary, including 3.2 hours per day engaging in leisure screen time. Fewer than 1 in 5 (19.1%) Canadian adults meet current sedentary behaviour recommendations. To minimize poor health outcomes, adults should limit daily sedentary time to 8 hours or less per day with no more than 3 hours of leisure screen time.Footnote 1Activities that require very little movement, such as sitting or reclining, are called sedentary behaviours. Common sedentary behaviours include watching TV, sitting at a desk, or driving in an automobile. Research shows that sedentary behaviour is associated with an increased risk of chronic disease and other poor health outcomes.Footnote 3 Canadian children and youth spend approximately 8.4 hours of their day sedentary including 3.8 hours of leisure screen time. Only about half (53.3%) of Canadian children and youth meet current sedentary behaviour recommendations. To achieve optimal health and minimize negative health outcomes, children and youth should engage in no more than 2 hours per day of leisure screen time.Footnote 2 Sleep Canadian adults get an average of 8.0 hours of sleep per night and 72.7% meet current sleep recommendations. Canadian adults ages 18 to 64 years should obtain 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep on a regular basis and adults ages 65 years and older should obtain 7 to 8 hours of sleep on a regular basis.Footnote 1 Sleep supports healthy brain function and plays a vital role in good health and well-being. Insufficient sleep has been associated with various negative health outcomes, including chronic diseases, poor mental health and increased chance of death.Footnote 4 Canadian children and youth get an average of 9.0 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period and 70.7% meet current sleep recommendations. Canadian children ages 5 to 13 years should obtain 9 to 11 hours of sleep per night and youth ages 14 to 17 years should obtain 8 to 10 hours per night.Footnote 2 24-Hour Only 1 in 20 (5.9%) Canadian adults meet all three of the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep. Similarly, fewer than 1 in 10 (9.5%) children and youth meet all three recommendations. Canadians are active at home, at work and in their communities. Monitoring movement behaviours in specific environments gives us a clearer picture of what is going on. Active travel: In 2021, 2 in 5 (41.7%) Canadian adults and 3 in 5 (61.0%) youth report using active ways like walking or cycling to get to places such as work or school. Compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of youth engaging in active transportation has significantly declined by 14.7 percentage points (75.6% in 2018 vs. 60.9% in 2021). Using active modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, provides an important opportunity for Canadians to be active and increase their overall level of physical activity, while also improving cardiorespiratory fitness.Footnote 5 Sport participation and free play: Organized sport can provide important opportunities for children and youth to achieve physical activity. Physical activity can also be accumulated through unstructured free play during leisure time. About half of children and youth (54.4%) participated in organized sports with a coach or instructor in the past week and reported an average of 2.8 hours of organized sport per week. Two thirds of children (68.1%) reported 3 hours or less per week of unstructured free play outside of school and youth reported an average of 2.4 hours per week participating in outdoor physical activity during their free time. Regularly participating in sports (organized or free play) is associated with higher levels of physical activity, lower levels of sedentary behaviour and overall better mental health outcomes in children and youth.Footnote 6Footnote 7 Use of electronic media in the bedroom: About 2 in 3 (65.4%) Canadian adults report having an electronic device such as a cellphone, television or computer in their bedroom while sleeping and 66.4% report using electronic devices within 30 minutes of falling asleep. Over 2 in 5 (45.3%) Canadian children and youth report using electronic devices in the bedroom before falling asleep. Using electronic devices before bedtime can increase cognitive activity and make it difficult to relax and fall asleep, this can lead to poor sleep quality.Footnote 8Footnote 9 The PASS Indicators recognize that some broader factors, like family relationships and societal norms, as well as how communities are built (for example, bike lanes and access to parks), all have an impact on a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daily activities. Physical activity and the family/social environment: About 1 in 3 (35.4%) Canadian youth report that they do physical activity with their parents at least weekly and about half (57.5%) report that their close friends are involved in physical activity on a regular basis. Parental and peer support, including role modelling, material support and encouragement have been associated with greater participation, enjoyment, and confidence in physical activity among youth.Footnote 10Footnote 11Footnote 12Footnote 13 Access to parks and recreational facilities: The majority of Canadians (87.4% of adults and 90.0% of youth) report that their neighbourhood has several free or low-cost recreational facilities such as parks, walking trails, bike paths, recreation centers, playgrounds, or public swimming pools. Having accessible facilities (in terms of location and cost) helps increase the physical activity of Canadians. For an overview of all the healthy living indicators reported on in the PASS Indicators see the PASS Quick Stats page. To view additional indicators and each indicator by sociodemographic characteristics such as sex, age group, education, household income, cultural/racial background, Indigenous identity, and immigrant status please visit the PASS Data Tool page. The PASS Indicators are intended to support a comprehensive surveillance of movement behaviours in Canada. In addition to the indicators currently in the PASS framework, new indicators will be released as appropriate measures and data sources are identified, such as physical literacy, presence and types of barriers for physical activity, community walkability, workplace sedentary time, awareness about sleep benefits and several more. Adapting existing data sources or developing new sources of information and measurement tools will be important to fill current data gaps and improve our reporting.

What is an Indicator Framework? Published: (2017-05-11) An indicator framework answers the call for easily digestible data. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one to peruse scientific data, you may already know what an indicator framework is. For those who are new to the concept, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s break it down. An indicator is a single data element \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a snapshot of the state, level or measure of something. A framework is simply the structure of \u00e2\u0080\u009ca system, concept, or text\u00e2\u0080\u009d. An indicator framework is an organized way to view data from different sources. It is a simple and concise way to present gathered data and help show the relevance and connection between different indicators. In a framework, data can be grouped or categorized and are often shown alongside detailed descriptions of associated measures and methods of calculation. Table 1: Anatomy of an Indicator Framework Data Category Data Group Measure Single Data Element Different Sources Social and Environmental Determinants Education % of population with less than a high school education, population aged 20+ years. 12.8% CCHS (2014) Income % of population living below low-income cut-offs, after tax, total population. 9.7% CIS (2013) Employment Average annual unemployment rate (% of labour force that was unemployed during reference period), population aged 15+ years. 6.8% LFS (2015) How does this help make scientific data more easily accessible? An indicator framework can be tailored to showcase the most important data from a report. Instead of skimming through 50+ pages for the three statistics you need, you can view them all on one page, and even compare them with others that you may not have considered. There you have it! All the data you need - bite sized. So what do indicator frameworks look like anyway? Here are some cool examples: Canadian Chronic Disease Indicators The Canadian Chronic Disease Indicators (CCDI) is a comprehensive pan-Canadian resource on the burden of chronic diseases, injuries and associated determinants.

What is sedentary behaviour and how do we measure it? Published: (2018-06-28) The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) reports on a range of indicators related to Canadians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep habits. These indicators are organized in a framework called the Physical Activity, Sedentary behaviour and Sleep (PASS) Indicator Framework. The information provided by the PASS Indicator Framework will inform programs and policy to improve the health of Canadians. What is sedentary behaviour? Sedentary behaviour refers to activities that we do while we are sitting, reclining or lying down and expending very little energy. Some examples include watching television, using a computer or tablet, and sitting in a bus, car or train. Experts in the field recently defined sedentary behaviour and all of its associated caveats.Footnote 1 It is important to note that sedentary behaviour is not simply the absence of physical activity but has been shown to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even if you exercise! Footnote 2 Canadians spend the majority of their time being sedentary, in fact the average Canadian child/youth and adult spends 8.4 and 9.6 hours per day engaged in sedentary behaviour, respectively. Footnote 3 Replacing sedentary time with even light physical activity can have health benefits. Why is measuring sedentary behaviour important? Because greater sedentary behaviour is recognized as a risk factor for many chronic diseases, population health organizations such as PHAC, track it for surveillance purposes. Footnote 4 Tracking helps to assess this behaviour in the Canadian population over time, identify whether one segment of the population is more sedentary than another (e.g., adults vs. children) and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on reducing sedentary time. For example, surveillance work has identified that only 28.5% of Canadian children and youth report meeting the new sedentary behaviour component of the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, by spending 2 hours or less per day watching television or using a computer during leisure time.Footnote 3 How is sedentary behaviour measured? New technologies provide the ability to objectively measure how much sedentary time an individual gets using research accelerometers which continuously track movement and intensity. The Canadian Health Measures Survey currently uses these types of devices. While these devices provide more precise estimates of sedentary behaviour over an entire day, they can be costly and require more time for both the survey respondents who must wear and return them and for those who analyze the data. In addition, these devices cannot easily provide information around the types of sedentary behaviour a person engages in. They can, however, be used to interpret reporting error in self-reported measures. Due to these limitations, population health surveillance strategies often rely on self-report measures of sedentary behaviour using questionnaires. These questionnaire tools offer more flexibility in terms of identifying time spent in different types of sedentary behaviour and their affordability allows for their inclusion on large scale surveys which collect data on subpopulations (such as all provinces and territories in Canada). How is the measurement of sedentary behaviour changing? With the arrival of smartphones, tablets, and newer technologies, how and why Canadians engage in sedentary behaviour has greatly changed, and is continuing to change. Historically, Canadians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sedentary behaviour habits were largely assessed by asking individuals how much leisure time they spent watching television, on the computer, playing video games or reading (starting with the Canadian Community Health Survey in 2000-01). While these are some of the main types of sedentary behaviour, there are now several others. Many Canadians now spend a lot of time sitting while commuting in a car, bus or train, and many are using other technologies such as tablets and smartphones and multitask between devices. For example, you might be watching TV, but also reading email on your smartphone. Special care must be taken in surveys to avoid over counting sedentary time in these situations. With newer technologies and greater reliance on motorized transport, PHAC developed the PASS Indicator Framework as an effort to stay current with changing behaviours in the population in their surveillance strategies. This includes efforts to update questions for use on large, national population health surveys. PHAC partnered with Canadian researchers to design a new self-report tool to measure sedentary behaviour in the Canadian population. The tool is based on best practices from international surveys and the literature for self-report measurement of sedentary behaviour. The series of questions; now referred to as the International Sedentary Assessment Tool (ISAT), was recently published.Footnote 5 It is available for use in future surveys or other questionnaires and can be downloaded in Word format.

What is the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program? Published: (2019-01-22) The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) actively monitors rare and/or emerging diseases and conditions in children and youth. It examines conditions that are high-risk in terms of disability and economic costs to society, despite their low frequency. Since 1996, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Society have maintained CPSP with the voluntary contribution of over 2700 paediatricians and other doctors who provide specialized care for children and youth. Over 75 surveillance studies and over 50 one-time surveys have been completed, covering a diverse range of topics including: Acute flaccid paralysis (monitoring for polio) Health hazards related to the consumption of energy drinks Congenital Zika syndrome Childhood Lyme disease Injuries related to liquid detergent packets Adverse drug reactions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 serious and life threatening Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder Severe alcohol intoxication in adolescents Cannabis for medical purposes Vaccine hesitancy Type 2 diabetes Vitamin D deficiency rickets Tuberculosis All of CPSP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concluded studies and current studies are available online. How does CPSP surveillance work? Each month, participating doctors receive an initial report form from the CPSP listing the conditions currently under surveillance. They are asked to indicate the number of new cases they have seen in that month. For each case reported, the CPSP mails out a detailed case report form for the doctor to complete. Note that the patient remains anonymous as no directly identifying information is included (e.g., child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, health insurance number). Detailed case reports are returned to the program where a team of investigators analyzes the data and reports on findings: DetectionThe CPSP gathers data from up to 2700 paediatricians and other doctors who provide specialized care for children and youth across Canada each month to monitor conditions of interest.CPSP gathers only anonymized data already captured in patient charts. DeductionTeams of CPSP investigators analyze and interpret the data in order to better understand how to prevent or control the conditions. DisseminationStudy results are published by the CPSP and other sources and are acted upon to improve the health of children and youth in Canada. An average of 10 CPSP surveillance studies are underway at any given time. There are three types of studies: ongoing studies, time-limited studies, and one-time surveys. The two ongoing surveillance studies include: Surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (monitoring for polio) - since 1996. Reporting of severe and life-threatening adverse drug reactions - since 2004. Time-limited studies are conducted for a defined period of time, typically 2 years, though they can be extended or repeated. As not all national surveillance questions warrant a complete study, the CPSP conducts one-time surveys to help capture a signal, or answer a specific emerging public health concern. Three new one-time surveys are launched each year. All CPSP study protocols and forms are available on the CPSP website. How are diseases and conditions identified for surveillance? An application to start a CPSP surveillance study or one-time survey can be submitted at any time by investigators. The CPSP office works with the investigators to refine the application and seek approval from the CPSP Steering Committee. For more information about the application process and the criteria for selection, visit the CPSP application webpage. How are CPSP Results reported and used? CPSP study results are published in: annual reports medical journals CPSP Highlights published in Paediatrics and Child Health CPS News at conferences and more! Results can be useful to researchers, policy, program and support professionals, health care professionals, patients and families and others seeking to improve the health of children and youth. What are some examples of CPSP study results making a difference in the lives of Canadians? CPSP Surveillance studies and one-time surveys have informed: Public health policies and legislation The total ban on the sale of baby walkers in Canada and the legislation requiring booster seats in cars to prevent seat-belt syndrome. Professional medical guidelines Guidelines such as the practice point on Zika virus, and position statement on medical assistance in dying. Public health promotion and education Efforts to prevent vitamin D deficiency rickets and to prevent the use of e-cigarettes in those under the legal age to use conventional tobacco products. How does the CPSP work with other countries? Diseases can cross borders and surveillance systems are more nimble and effective when techniques and results are shared. The CPSP actively collaborates with 12 other paediatric surveillance units worldwide through the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INOPSU).

In 2019, suicide was the ninth leading cause of death in Canada. However, it was the second leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 34. In Canada, the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention aims to: reduce stigma and raise public awareness connect people in Canada with information and resources accelerate the use of research and innovation in suicide prevention To support this, the Public Health Agency of Canada developed the Suicide Surveillance Indicator Framework. This interactive data tool shows statistics on suicide and self-harm and their risk and protective factors. This data blog complements the framework by providing more information to stakeholders and the public. This keeps them better informed and improves access to the latest statistics on suicide in Canada.

Data on the number of self-harm hospitalizations is from the Canadian Institute of Health Information. Data on suicide attempts, suicide plans, and thoughts of suicide is from the Canadian Community Health Surveys. The number of deaths by suicide excludes Yukon. The number of self-harm hospitalizations includes people aged 10 years and older from all provinces and territories. These 3 categories include people aged 15 years and older from all provinces and territories: People who reported having attempted suicide. People who made suicide plans. People who had serious thoughts of suicide.

However, suicide mortality rates have changed for some groups in the population in recent decades. Rates have: decreased among males aged: 10-14 25-64 75 and older increased among females aged: 10-24 45-64 Self-harm hospitalizations Each year, thousands of people in Canada are hospitalized after intentionally harming themselves. Non-fatal self-harm injuries are a significant risk factor for suicide, and monitoring hospitalizations for self-harm is critical for suicide prevention. Self-harm hospitalization rates are higher among females than males. Females aged 10 to 19 years old have the highest rate among all age groups and for both sexes. Rates of hospitalizations for self-harm vary by geographic location. They are 6.5 times higher in very remote areas compared to urban areas. Suicide-related behaviours Other types of suicide-related behaviours include: attempting suicide making a suicide plan having serious thoughts of suicide During their lifetime, many people in Canada aged 15 and older will experience suicide-related behaviours. Almost 1 million will attempt suicide. 1.3 million will make suicide plans. 3.8 million will have serious thoughts of suicide. Among people aged 15 to 19 years old, rates of suicide-related behaviours are higher in females than in males. Compared to males: suicide attempts are 5 times higher in females suicide plans are almost 4 times higher in females serious thoughts of suicide are 2 times higher in females Suicide affects all groups in the population, but some have substantially higher risk of: attempting suicide making suicide plans having thoughts of suicide People who are more likely to experience suicidal ideation than others are those: born in Canada who never married younger than 65 years with a lower level of education Compared to heterosexual and cisgender populations, people who are 2SLGBTQI+ are more likely to: make suicide attempts make suicide plans have thoughts of suicide Suggested citation Public Health Agency of Canada.

SCS data can provide early warning signals by detecting changes in: drug use and harms demographics of people using drugs types of drugs used What we track This page provides national data as well as data for each supervised consumption site (SCS). We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include data from other sites, such as urgent public health needs sites (commonly known as overdose prevention sites). We track: total number of visits to SCSs number of different clients client demographics (gender, age) number of drugs consumed by drug type number of referrals to health and social services number of overdoses and drug emergencies number of overdoses requiring the use of naloxone number of calls to emergency medical services (EMS) Definitions of indicators Total visits Total number of times people used a site during the reporting period. Unique clients Number of different people using a site during the monthly reporting period. A person will only be counted once by a site each month, but the same person could be counted more than once when looking at data covering a period longer than one month. Non-fatal overdoses Number of drug overdoses that took place in an SCS during the reporting period and which did not result in death. To date, nobody has died of an overdose in an SCS in Canada. Total service referrals Any referral made to health or social support services that are offered within the SCS, in a connected onsite location, or offsite in a different location. Service referrals provided within the SCS Any referral made to health or social support services not directly related to drug consumption, that are offered within the SCS space (for example, a nurse holding a clinic within the space). This can include: wound care testing for STBBIs (sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections) primary health care mental health care food and shelter services legal aid employment assistance other service referrals Service referrals provided onsite Any referral made to health or social support services not directly related to drug consumption, that are offered within the same building as the SCS, but not in the SCS space (for example, an SCS which is attached to a community health centre). This can include: wound care testing for STBBIs (sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections) primary health care mental health care food and shelter services legal aid employment assistance other onsite referrals Service referrals provided offsite Any referral made to health or social support services not directly related to drug consumption, that are offered at a different location than the SCS or the building that the SCS is located in. This can include: wound care testing for STBBIs (sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections) primary health care mental health care food and shelter services legal aid employment assistance other off-site referrals Average visits per day Total number of visits to all sites divided by the total number of days sites were operating during the reporting period. Average new clients per month Total number of clients new to a particular SCS, summed for all sites and divided by number of sites reporting in the monthly reporting period. Drugs used Number of times a certain drug was consumed in the sites during the reporting period. Overdoses requiring naloxone Number of drug overdoses that required the use of naloxone (a fast-acting drug that can temporarily reverse the effects of opioid overdoses). Emergency medical services Number of times EMS services (ambulance/paramedics) were called during the reporting period. Other medical services Number of other medical emergencies (not related to overdose events) that occurred during the reporting period. Law enforcement Number of calls made for police services, which could be for any number of reasons and are not necessarily related to a crime or violence. Other internal services Number of times services internal to the SCS were offered to clients during the reporting period. Data limitations Each SCS provides a standardized data report to Health Canada every month. Prior to March 2020, the reporting data wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely standardized. Therefore, for the sites operating at any point prior to March 2020, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report on some data due to missing or inconsistent reporting, including: site-level data data on trends client demographics type of drug used calls for help services within the site There is a delay of about 2 months between when we receive data and when we post it. This allows us time for data entry and validation. Individual SCS may interpret each category of services and referrals differently. For this reason, use caution when interpreting totals for each category.

Last updated: 2023-12-04 Adults aged 65 years and older are at increased risk for falls. This risk can be attributed to a number of factors, which can include decreased mobility and balance, muscle weakness and visual impairment among individuals.Footnote 1 Fall-related injuries among older adults can have serious health and social consequences, impacting the quality of lives and even causing deaths. In Canada, as the population ages and life expectancy increases, mortality rates associated with falls have increased by 111% between 2001 and 2019 among adults aged 65 years and older. Similarly, the number of fall-related hospitalizations in Canada among this population rose by 47% from 2008 to 2019Footnote * (this estimate excludes Quebec).Footnote 2 In 2018, it was estimated that the direct cost of fall-related injuries among Canadian adults aged 65 years and older was approximately $5.6 billion, a cost doubling that among those in the 25 to 64 years age groupFootnote3. As adults aged 65 years and older are expected to represent over a fifth of the Canadian population by 2068Footnote 4, continuing to monitor fall-related injuries and deaths among this population and examining associated risk factors will be important measures that can help guide and inform prevention efforts. In this light, the Public Health Agency of Canada released a comprehensive report in 2022 presenting national-level health statistics on falls among adults aged 65 years and older using a variety of health data sources. This data blog builds on this report in that it provides the most recent national-level statistics on fall-related deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits among older adults in Canada. Information on factors contributing to falls is also provided to help inform prevention efforts. Deaths due to falls Figure 1 presents numbers on deaths and mortality rates due to falls by age and sex. In 2021, 6,579 adults aged 65 years and older died of falls in Canada (this estimate excludes Yukon). As shown, mortality rates generally rose with age among both men and women. In each age group, men had higher mortality rates compared to women, yet women had a higher overall rate (95.9 per 100,000 vs 89.5 per 100,000). In total, more women died from falls (n =3,657) compared to men (n = 2,922), a finding reflecting the fact that there are more women than men aged 65 years and older in Canada. Figure 1: Number of fall-related deaths and mortality rates, by age and sex, population aged 65 years and older, Canada (Yukon not included), 2021 Age group (years) Count (Men) Count (Women) Rate per 100,000 (Men) Rate per 100,000 (Women) 65 to 69 174 83 16.1 7.2 70 to 74 297 174 33.6 18.0 75 to 79 324 303 54.0 44.5 80 to 84 518 510 138.7 108.9 85 to 89 724 855 338.8 274.2 90+ 885 1,732 800.9 733.9 All 65+ 2,922 3,657 89.5 95.9 Fall-related hospitalizations Figure 2 presents numbers on fall-related hospitalizations and rates by age and sex. In 2022Footnote *, there were 78,076 fall-related hospitalizations (this estimate excludes Quebec) among adults aged 65 years and older, representing 88.6% of all injury-related hospitalizations among this age group. Of these falls, women accounted for nearly two-thirds of such hospitalizations (n = 49,919). For both men and women, hospitalization rates increased with age, yet those among women were consistently higher compared to men. Over a third (34.4%) of fall-related hospitalizations (n = 26,848) among adults aged 65 years and older were associated with a hip fracture.

In 2022Footnote *, there were 200,825 fall-related ED visits reported in Ontario and Alberta among adults aged 65 years and older. Of these ED visits, nearly two-thirds were among (n = 126,765) women. Similar to hospitalizations, ED rates increased with age for both men and women, and those among women were consistently higher compared to men.

Fall prevention efforts generally entail a multifaceted approach, consisting of a number of key strategies. At the individual level, for instance, participating in balance and strength exercises, obtaining proper sleep, eating well and staying hydrated are strategies that may reduce the risk of falls among older adults. At the community level, providing educational opportunities to older adults on fall prevention strategies (i.e knowledge of medical equipment, exercise programs and fall prevention skills), installing handrails and grab bars, and removing debris such as snow and ice from public walkways are examples of broader scale approaches.

AMR happens naturally, but the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in people, animals and plants is increasing the problem. AMR pathogens can spread easily among people and animals. The Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) integrates and synthesizes information from various surveillance systems and laboratory reference services covering humans, animals and food to present data on AMR and antimicrobial use in the human (hospital and community) and animal settings.

Last updated: 2023-11-24 Antimicrobial use Results Antimicrobial use Results Antimicrobials, especially antibiotics, are a critical component of modern medicine that are regularly used to treat and prevent infections. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a natural phenomenon that occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve over time to resist the effects of antimicrobials used to treat or prevent infections. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics is a well-known factor for accelerating the rates of AMR. The Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) integrates and synthesizes information from various surveillance systems and laboratory reference services covering humans, animals, and food to present data on AMR and antimicrobial use (AMU) in the human (hospital and community) and animal settings. Key Findings Human antimicrobial use continues to decrease, however inappropriate prescribing is common. Between 2017 and 2022, antimicrobial consumption in the healthcare sector decreased across all Canadian jurisdictions and the annual number of prescriptions filled by retail pharmacies in the community and the total number of prescriptions decreased. From 2019 to 2022, there was a decrease in the average monthly prescription rate in the community sector, with the greatest decrease during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 to May 2021). From 2018 to 2022, nearly one-fifth of prescriptions were deemed inappropriate or suboptimal in participating Canadian healthcare facilities. Antimicrobials sold for use in animals decreased, however farm-level antimicrobial use increased in some sectors. Between 2020 and 2021, the quantity of medically important antimicrobials sold for use in all animals in Canada decreased. The quantity of antimicrobials used on sentinel farms increased for broiler chickens and grower-finisher pigs (across all AMU measures), increased for turkeys in kgs and remained stable in mg/PCU. In 2021, when compared to the 30 European countries reporting to ESAC-Net for total consumption (combining use in healthcare and community sectors), Canada was the tenth lowest consumer or antimicrobials per capita. In the animal sector, ESVAC Network data ranked Canada the seventh highest consumer in terms of quantities (mg/PCU) of antimicrobials sold for use in production animals (including horses) compared to European countries. Notes Source: IQVIA and Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) Between 2018 and 2021, the average quantity (in kg) of antimicrobials sold for use in animals was almost 4.1 times the amount consumed in humans for the nine most reported antimicrobial classes. Penicillins were the most consumed antibiotics by humans (annual average of 113,168.1 kg), whereas tetracyclines were the antimicrobial class with the highest quantity (in kg) sold for use in animals (annual average of 525,888.3 kg). In 2021, the tonnage of tetracyclines sold for use in animals was 66.7 times the amount consumed by humans. In 2021, the top three antimicrobials used in humans were penicillins (89,376.5 kg), first and second generation cephalosporins (36,771.3 kg) and sulfamethoxazole (18,079.6 kg). In 2021, the top three antimicrobials with the highest amounts sold for use in animals were tetracyclines (517,908 kg), penicillins (129,711 kg), and macrolides (102,667 kg). Setting Healthcare Human Antimicrobial Use in the Healthcare Sector National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey Community Human Antimicrobial Use in the Community Human Antimicrobial Use in the Community before and during the COVID-19 pandemic Animal Antimicrobials sold for use in animals Farm-level surveillance of AMU and AMR Comparison of antimicrobial consumption in humans and antimicrobials sold for use in animals in Canada and European countries in 2021 In 2021, Canada was the tenth lowest consumer of antimicrobials per capita compared to the 30 European countries reporting to ESAC-Net for the total consumption (combining antimicrobial use in healthcare and community sectors), whereas ESVAC Network data ranked Canada the seventh highest consumer in terms of quantities (mg/PCU) of antimicrobials sold for use in production animals (including horses) compared to European countries. Human AMU data shows that Canada consumed nearly 50.0% more antimicrobials than Germany (the country with the lowest consumption) and nearly half of the amount consumed by Romania (the country with the highest consumption). Animal AMU data shows that the quantity sold for use in production animals (mg/PCU) was three times higher than the median of the European countries. Notes Human AMU data are ordered from lowest to highest, and animal AMU data were included based on this order. Data in the figure above represent totals in human consumption, data in healthcare and community sectors combined where applicable; data for Germany and Iceland are only data from the community sector, data from the healthcare sector were not reported in the ESAC-Net data by these two countries.

Last updated: 2024-01-19 Key findings Data tables Key findings Data tables On this page Highlights Overview Key findings by theme Technical notes Survey notes References Highlights People in Canada are generally aware that higher alcohol consumption increases the risk of certain alcohol-related harms. However, most don't know about the cancer risks at low consumption levels Over one-third are not familiar with the concept of a \"standard drink\". Among those who are, many struggle to put the concept into practice when beverages don't come in a single-serving container Most people agree that the labels on alcohol products should display or provide: the number of standard drinks (62%) guidance to reduce health risks (60%) health warnings (55%) More than half (59%) believe that alcohol should not be exempt from the health information labels required for other regulated products, such as tobacco and cannabis Most believe that such health labelling of alcohol products would help them: track their alcohol consumption think more readily about alcohol-related harms think about cutting back on drinking or talking to others about cutting back Overview In Canada, alcohol is a legal and socially accepted psychoactive substance. However, the latest scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that any amount of alcohol poses health risksFootnote 1. Alcohol is linked to numerous health conditions, including 7 types of cancer and liver diseaseFootnote 2. To better understand awareness of alcohol-related harms, Health Canada developed and implemented the Public Awareness of Alcohol-related Harms Survey (PAAHS). The PAAHS assesses the public's knowledge and opinions about: educational campaigns about alcohol national drinking guidelines standard drink measurements awareness of alcohol-related health risks health labelling of alcohol products About the sample Survey recipients were randomly recruited from all provinces and territories in Canada. There were 9,812 participants aged 16 years and older surveyed between February 13 and June 30, 2023. The results are weighted to match population proportions based on region, age and sex. The overall sample includes both consumers and non-consumers of alcohol. However, some survey questions were directed only to those who had previously consumed alcohol, as noted throughout the text below. A small subset of respondents (n=435) who had never consumed alcohol was excluded from those analyses that specifically focused on current and former consumers (see Definitions). PAAHS results are organized by theme. Within each theme, factors such as age, alcohol consumption status, and sex or gender are considered. For more details about the sample and the analysis, please refer to the Survey notes. Details about the survey methodology from the archived report are available on the Library and Archives Canada website. Key findings by theme Awareness of alcohol education campaigns and messages All respondents were asked about their awareness of recent educational campaigns and public health messages about alcohol risks and safer drinking practices. Overall, 81% of people said they had noticed alcohol-related messaging in the past 12 months, while 19% had not noticed any. There were no meaningful differences by gender, age, or alcohol consumption status. Common sources of messaging (see Figure 1) included: TV or radio (59%) print newspapers or magazines (25%) social media (25%) Additional information on the awareness of education campaigns is available in the archived report. Figure 1. Sources of alcohol messaging in the past 12 months, by Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023 Notes #: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed Source: PAAHS 2023 Awareness of alcohol drinking guidelines All respondents were asked about their awareness of \"Canada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines\" (LRDG) or \"Canada's Guidance on Alcohol and Health\" (CGAH) (see Survey notes). The survey also asked people where they had first encountered alcohol drinking guidelines. Overall, 59% of people were aware of the LRDG or CGAH (Figure 2). They most commonly reported hearing of them through: TV or radio (61%) print newspapers or magazines (12%) social media (8%) Awareness of the guidelines was lowest among youth (40% of 16 to 19 year olds) and increased with age. Guideline awareness was also lower among former consumers of alcohol (50%). There was no meaningful difference by gender. Figure 2. Awareness of alcohol drinking guidelines, by Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023 Notes #: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed Source: PAAHS 2023 Knowledge of standard drink measurements People who had never consumed alcohol (excluding occasional sips for religious or other purposes), did not participate in this section of the survey and are not included in this analysis. First, respondents identified their typical alcoholic beverage of choice. Then, if they were familiar with the term \"standard drink\", they were shown an image of this beverage (Figure 3) and asked to determine the number of standard drinks in the container. The image displayed the container's volume and the beverage's percentage of alcohol by volume. Figure 3. Images of alcohol containers shown to respondents to determine number of standard drinks Text description Alcohol containers displayed from left to right: Beer, 341 ml (12 oz), 5% alcohol by volume Spirits, 750 ml (25 oz), 40% alcohol by volume Wine, 750 ml (25 oz), 12% alcohol by volume Cider/cooler, 341 ml (12 oz), 5% alcohol by volume Typical alcoholic beverage: When asked which alcoholic beverage they typically consumed, people replied: wine (43%) beer (28%) spirits (22%) cider or coolers (7%) Wine was most popular among women (56%), while men favored beer (41%). By age, younger people (16 to 19 years old and 20 to 24 years old) preferred beer and spirits, while older people (25 to 49 years old and those aged 50 years and older) preferred wine and beer. By alcohol consumption status, consumers preferred wine and beer, while former consumers preferred wine and spirits. Familiarity with \"standard drink\": 61% of people who had ever consumed alcohol were familiar with the term \"standard drink\". There were no meaningful differences by age or gender. Consumers (62%) were more familiar with the term than former consumers (48%). Putting standard drinks into practice: Overall, 70% of those familiar with the term \"standard drink\" incorrectly determined the number of standard drinks in the image of their typical alcoholic beverage. This is despite being provided with the information necessary to calculate the answer. More results by specific beverage type are provided below. People familiar with the term \"standard drink\" were more accurate when their typical beverage came pre-portioned in a single-serving container, such as beer, cider or coolers. Beer: Among those shown the bottle of beer, 89% correctly determined that it contained 1.0 standard drink. Six percent (6%) of people estimated that it contained 2.0 standard drinks. The average response was 1.2 standard drinks, while the median was 1.0. Most people answered correctly, but for those who got it wrong, the tendency was to overestimate Spirits: Among those shown the bottle of spirits, 30% underestimated the number of standard drinks, and almost all (99%) failed to determine that it contained 17.6 standard drinks. Nearly half (48%) of people estimated 25.0 standard drinks. The average response was 22.1 standard drinks, while the median was 25.0 Wine: Among those shown the bottle of wine, 58% underestimated the number of standard drinks, and almost all (99%) failed to determine that it contained 5.3 standard drinks. Most people were relatively close; common responses were 5.0 standard drinks (38%), 6.0 standard drinks (25%), and 4.0 standard drinks (16%). The average response was 6.3 standard drinks, while the median was 5.0 Cider/coolers: Among those shown the can of cider or cooler, 61% correctly determined that it contained 1.0 standard drink. A quarter (25%) of people estimated 2.0 standard drinks. The average response was 1.5 standard drinks, while the median was 1.0. This indicates most people answered correctly but for those who got it wrong, the tendency was to overestimate Due to small sample sizes, these results are not reported by gender, age or alcohol consumption status. Perceptions of alcohol-related health risks All respondents were asked about their perceptions of the impacts of different levels of alcohol consumption on their risk of 11 specific health conditions (Figure 4): arthritis diabetes liver disease colon cancer mouth cancer throat cancer heart disease breast cancer high cholesterol being overweight or obese harm to a fetus during pregnancy Alcohol is known to increase the risk of all these health conditions except arthritis. Its effect on diabetes is complexFootnote 3. Figure 4. Beliefs of the impact of Select a drink amount: of alcohol per week on the risk of health conditions, Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023 Notes #: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed Source: PAAHS 2023 General beliefs about alcohol and health conditions People tended to believe that higher levels of alcohol consumption increased their risk for any of the listed health conditions. Similarly, they were more inclined to believe that low levels of alcohol consumption (1 to 2 standard drinks per week) had no impact on risk. Some people believe that alcohol decreases the risk of health conditions, especially at low levels of consumption. For example, 6% of people believed 1 to 2 standard drinks per week decreased their risk of heart disease. People tended to believe that alcohol \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of the amount consumed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increased their risk for: harm to a fetus during pregnancy liver disease being overweight or obese diabetes People were less likely to believe that alcohol increased their risk for: arthritis mouth cancer throat cancer breast cancer Across all levels of consumption, roughly one-third of people weren't sure about the impact of alcohol on their risk of: high cholesterol colon cancer breast cancer throat cancer mouth cancer arthritis Awareness of cancer risk If a respondent already knew that alcohol increases the risk of breast, colon, throat, or mouth cancers, they were asked when they first became aware of this: more than a year ago (56%) in the last year (16%) in the last month (8%) in the last week (1%) didn't know (18%) Most people who already knew of the increased risk of cancer from alcohol, reported that they first learned about it from: TV or radio (39%) print newspapers or magazines (13%) health care settings (10%) school (8%) non-social media websites (6%) social media (5%) Notably, school was the first source of this information for many 16 to 19 year olds (34%) and 20 to 24 year olds (22%). TV or radio was the first source for a large proportion of 25 to 49 year olds (37%) and people aged 50 years and older (46%). Awareness of risk by sex, age and alcohol consumption status Awareness of risk associated with alcohol consumption differed by sex, age and alcohol consumption status. More female respondents than male respondents believed alcohol increased their risk of certain health conditions such as breast cancer or harm to a fetus during pregnancy. These differences between males and females were more pronounced for lower levels of consumption (1 to 2 or 3 to 6 standard drinks per week). Youth were also more likely to believe that alcohol increases the risk of certain health conditions. For instance, 60% of 16 to 19 year olds believed that 1 to 2 standard drinks per week increases the risk of heart disease. This is in contrast to the proportion of other age groups with the same belief (51% of 20 to 24 year olds, 44% of 25 to 29 year olds, and 41% of those aged 50 years and older). Similar patterns of awareness were observed for high cholesterol, liver disease, being overweight or obese, and harm to a fetus during pregnancy (Figure 4). Former consumers were more inclined than current consumers to believe 1 to 2 and 3 to 6 standard drinks per week increase the risk of health conditions. At higher levels of alcohol consumption (7+ standard drinks per week), perceptions of risk were similar across these groups. Additional information on the awareness of risks is available in the archived report. Health labelling of alcohol products Figure 5. Images of labels shown to respondents (from left to right: warning label, standard drinks label, risk label) Text description Images of labels displayed from left to right: Warning label: Health Canada advises that alcohol causes cancer, including breast and colon cancers Standard drinks label: 750 ml at 12% alcohol by volume equals 5 standard drinks, and 750 ml at 15% alcohol by volume equals 7 standard drinks Risk label: The risk of consequences caused by alcohol increases with the number of standard drinks you have per week: 1 or 2 standard drinks per week is low risk 3 to 6 standard drinks per week is moderate risk 7 or more standard drinks per week is high risk All respondents were asked a series of questions related to the health labelling of alcohol products. Health warning labels and considering harms Overall, 75% of people indicated a health warning label would make them think about the harms caused by alcohol. This increased slightly to 77% when they were shown an example warning label (Figure 5). While there were no meaningful differences by age, women and former consumers of alcohol were more likely to report that this labelling would make them think about harms to a large or extremely large extent. Health warning labels and considering cutting back Overall, 68% of people said that a warning label would make them think about cutting back on their own drinking or talk to others about cutting back on their drinking. This increased slightly to 72% when they were shown an example warning label (Figure 5). Women and former consumers were more likely to report that the label would make them do so to a large or extremely large extent. Standard drink labels and tracking drinks More than half of people (57%) said they would use a standard drink label (Figure 5) to help them track their consumption of alcohol. Youth 16 to 19 years (70%) were more likely than other age groups to say they would use this label. There were no meaningful differences by gender or alcohol consumption status. Risk labels and considering cutting back About three-quarters (74%) of people said that risk labels with drink limits (Figure 5) would make them think about cutting back on their own drinking or talk to others about cutting back on their drinking. Women and former consumers were more likely to report that the risk label would make them think about harms to a large or extremely large extent. Support for the health labelling of alcohol products For all health labelling questions, most people agreed or strongly agreed that alcohol should provide more labelling information (Figure 6). Specifically, they showed the greatest agreement for labels showing: the number of standard drinks (62%) guidance to reduce health risks (60%) health warnings (55%) On the other hand, some people disagreed or strongly disagreed with labelling of alcohol, including: health warning labels (24%) risk labels (21%) standard drinks labels (19%) More than half of people (59%) believed that alcohol should not be exempt from the health information labels required for other regulated products, such as tobacco and cannabis. Additional information on the support for health labelling is available in the archived report. Figure 6. Support for various health labels on alcohol products: Select a survey question: for Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023 Notes #: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed Source: PAAHS 2023 Technical notes Sex and gender Recognizing that the risks, effects, influences, and consequences of alcohol use can vary based on biological sex and gender identity (see Survey notes), we use the terms: \"female\" and \"male\" when referring to sex-related results \"women\" and \"men\" when referring to gender-related results Statistical considerations Differences are reported when found to be statistically significant (pooled two proportion z test, where p\u22640.05) with a non-trivial effect size (Cohen's h, where h\u22650.2). This ensures that the results are both reliable (not due to chance) and meaningful (the difference has practical significance). To improve readability of the key findings, the term \"statistically significant\" is not repeated and the effect size is not reported. Where thresholds for significance and effect size are met, the difference between 2 estimates is referred to as \"meaningful\". At times, the findings say that differences are not meaningful even if the numbers are different. This means the difference lacks statistical and/or practical significance. Due to rounding or multiple responses, percentages may not always add up to 100. Definitions Alcohol consumption status: \"Consumers\" of alcohol are those who have consumed alcohol in the past 12 months \"Former consumers\" are those who have consumed alcohol in their lifetime but not in the past 12 months People who have never consumed alcohol are included in the overall sample but excluded from the analysis by alcohol consumption status, which focuses on consumers and former consumers Alcohol drinking guidelines: In 2011, the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction issued Canada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines (LRDG)Footnote 2, designed to help people make informed decisions about alcohol. In 2023, the Centre updated and rebranded these guidelines as Canada's Guidance on Alcohol and Health (CGAH)Footnote 1, based on the latest research regarding alcohol-related risks. In this summary, \"alcohol drinking guidelines\" refer to both the LRDG and the CGAH. The questionnaire asked respondents about their awareness of either, without distinguishing between them (see Survey notes) Standard drinkFootnote 1: In Canada, a standard drink is 17.05 millilitres (ml) or 13.45 grams of pure alcohol. This is the equivalent of: a bottle of beer (12 oz., 341 ml, 5% alcohol) a bottle of cider (12 oz., 341 ml, 5% alcohol) a glass of wine (5 oz., 142 ml, 12% alcohol) a shot glass of spirits (1.5 oz., 43 ml, 40% alcohol) Health labelling: In this summary, \"health labelling of alcohol products\" refers to the potential addition of labelling information to show: the number of standard drinks guidance to reduce health risks health warnings Survey notes CGAH release The Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction released new drinking guidance with significant media attention in January 2023, shortly before the survey's launch on February 13, 2023. The timing of this release likely influenced respondents' awareness of alcohol drinking guidelines: Canada's Guidance on Alcohol and Health (CGAH, 2023) Canada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines (LRDG, 2011) The PAAHS did not distinguish between awareness of the LRDG and CGAH. Therefore, this survey offers a snapshot of awareness of alcohol drinking guidelines in general, following the CGAH release. Sex and gender To participate, respondents had to disclose their sex at birth to ensure a representative sample. They did not have to disclose their gender, although 75% chose to. This resulted in a larger sample for sex (n=9,812) compared to gender (n=7,398) in the analyses. Data for transgender and non-binary respondents are not reported by gender as is done for men and women. This is because of the small sample size, a need to protect respondent anonymity, and to avoid poor quality estimates. Transgender and non-binary respondents are included in analyses of the sample overall and by age, sex and alcohol consumption status. Overrepresentation of alcohol consumers The PAAHS aimed to achieve a specific quota for alcohol consumption, where 75% of respondents reported consuming alcohol in the past 12 months and 25% had not consumed alcohol in the past 12 months. This quota was based on data from the 2019 Canadian Alcohol and Drug SurveyFootnote 4. Ultimately, 85% of the final sample reported having consumed alcohol in the past 12 months while 15% had not, indicating some overrepresentation of alcohol consumers. This may be due to volunteer bias, as the survey's title may have attracted people more interested in discussing alcohol-related topics because they consume alcohol. Health literacy assessment In the PAAHS sample, 20% of respondents were identified as having low or possibly low health literacy on the Canadian adaptation of the Newest Vital Sign health literacy assessment toolFootnote 5. Previous research estimates 60% of Canadians have low levels of health literacyFootnote 6. Estimates for the overall sample should be interpreted with caution as people with adequate health literacy are overrepresented. For results by health literacy, please refer to the archived report.

Last updated: 2024-03-26 Key findings Results Technical notes Key findings Results Technical notes On this page Context How developmental disorder hospitalization rates changed during the pandemic Most common reasons for developmental disorder hospitalizations before and during the pandemic COVID-19 cases among developmental disorder hospitalizations Changes in length of stay of developmental disorder hospitalizations during the pandemic Context Developmental disorders (DD) are a group of conditions characterized by differences in motor, cognitive, language, behaviour or sensory functioning. People with DD often have greater health care needs compared to those without, including more hospitalizations. This is largely due to co-occurring health conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures to control the spread of COVID-19 affected access to health care services across Canada. This was particularly true earlier in the pandemic. To better understand these changes in health service use in those with DD during the pandemic, this study compares trends in DD hospitalizations to all hospitalizations in Canada (except Quebec) between 2015/16 and 2021/22. For context, DD hospitalizations accounted for fewer than 1% of all hospitalizations each year between 2015/16 and 2021/22. Over half of DD hospitalizations were for males and over half were in people aged 18 or younger. Note: In this study, developmental disorder (DD) hospitalizations refers to hospitalizations that contained at least one DD code from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canada. See Technical notes tab for the DD case definition. The study spans from fiscal years 2015/16 to 2021/22, with the following distinct periods: Pre-pandemic period: 2015/16 to 2019/20 Pandemic period: first year (2020/21) and second year (2021/22) How developmental disorder hospitalization rates changed during the pandemic While DD hospitalizations declined during the first year of the pandemic, they returned to pre-pandemic levels during the second year, except for those aged 12 to 18. During the first year of the pandemic, the decrease in DD hospitalizations was similar to that of all hospitalizations. However, the decrease in DD hospitalizations was greater for males and for children aged 7 to 11. In the second year of the pandemic, DD hospitalizations increased more than all hospitalizations, particularly for females and youth aged 12 to 18. In fact, during the second year of the pandemic the hospitalization rate for this age group was significantly higher than in pre-pandemic years. The largest changes in the monthly rate of DD hospitalizations were in the early months of the pandemic (April to June 2020). For more details, refer to Results: How DD hospitalization rates changed during the pandemic. Most common reasons for developmental disorder hospitalizations before and during the pandemic Throughout the study period, mental and behavioural disorders were the most common reason for hospitalization among DD hospitalizations. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was the most common of these disorders. There was an increase in DD hospitalizations for mental and behavioural disorders over the study period. There was a decrease in DD hospitalizations for respiratory diseases during the pandemic period. Compared to other age groups, youth aged 12 to 18 were more commonly hospitalized for mental and behavioural disorders throughout the study period. For more details, refer to Results: Most common reasons for DD hospitalizations before and during the pandemic. COVID-19 cases among developmental disorder hospitalizations About 1.5% of DD hospitalizations in 2020/21 had COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) while in hospital, compared to 3.2% in 2021/22. This was slightly less than all hospitalizations (1.8% and 4.1% respectively). For more details, refer to Results: COVID-19 cases among DD hospitalizations. Changes in length of stay of developmental disorder hospitalizations during the pandemic Throughout the study period, DD hospitalizations were, on average, significantly longer compared to all hospitalizations. Length of stay of DD hospitalizations was not impacted by the pandemic, except for those aged 7 to 11 in the first year of the pandemic and those aged 0 to 6 in the second year. For these groups, the length of stay decreased. For more details, refer to Results: Changes in length of stay of DD hospitalizations during the pandemic. As we learn more about the impact of the pandemic, it's important to continue to monitor these trends, and to investigate if the DD population experienced delays in care or any longer-term impacts. It's also important to monitor the increasing trend in hospitalizations for mental and behavioural disorders in this population.

Key findings Data tables Key findings Data tables Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that may occur after exposure to potentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTEs), such as actual, perceived, or threatened death, or sexual violence. A PTSD diagnosis requires a trained and licensed clinician to assess a specific set of signs and symptoms. PTSD may be diagnosed if symptoms persist for more than one month and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.Footnote 1 The Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events (SMHSE) was conducted to better understand how stressful events can impact a person's mental health. It collected information on self-reported exposure to specific PPTEs experienced, positive screens for PTSD (i.e. moderate to severe symptoms identified using a screening tool) and self-reported diagnoses of PTSD by a healthcare professional. Data for cycle 1 of the SMHSE were collected among adults living in the 10 Canadian provinces, from August to December 2021. This data blog also provides more detailed tables on the data from the SMHSE. To see these tables, visit the \"Data tables\" tab above.

Summary of findings from SMHSE cycle 1 (August to December 2021) Prevalence of PPTE types 64.9% of adults in Canada reported experiencing at least one PPTE type in their lifetime. The most commonly reported PPTE types were: transportation accident (35.3%) physical assault (18.5%) life-threatening illness or injury (18.4%) Some PPTE types were much more common among women*, notably: sexual assault (15.4% among women; 4.4% among men) other unwanted sexual experience (23.4% among women; 6.4% among men) Prevalence of PTSD diagnosis 6.8% reported having received a diagnosis of PTSD by a health professional at any point in their lifetime. 5.4% reported currently being diagnosed with PTSD by a health professional. Prevalence of screening positive for PTSD Overall 8.0% of adults in Canada screened positive for PTSD (i.e., had moderate to severe symptoms). By age and gender* 10.2% among women, compared to 5.7% among men. 13.6% among those aged 18 to 24, compared to 3.3% among those aged 65+. By sociodemographic characteristics 9.9% among those in the lowest third of household income, compared to 7.5% and 7.0% for the middle and highest third, respectively. 9.1% among those with more than high school but less than university and 8.9% among those with high school or less, compared to 6.4% among those with a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree or higher. 12.1% among those who never married, compared to 10.2% among those who were separated, divorced, or widowed and 6.0% among those who were married or living common law. 9.0% among non-immigrants, compared to 5.3% among immigrants. By health and mental health factors 22.7% among those who rated their general health as fair or poor, compared to 5.8% among those who rated their general health as good, very good, or excellent. 28.9% among those who rated their general mental health as fair or poor, compared to 2.9% among those who rated their general mental health as good, very good, or excellent. 26.8% among those who reported having a current diagnosis of a mood and/or anxiety disorder, compared to 3.2% among those who did not. 18.4% among those who reported daily or almost daily heavy drinking in the past month, compared to 8.8% and 6.0% among those who reported less than daily heavy drinking and no heavy drinking, respectively. 24.4% among those who reported daily cannabis use in the past month, compared to 13.9% and 6.3% among those who reported less than daily and no cannabis use, respectively. 26.1% among those who reported ever having seriously contemplated suicide, compared to 4.5% among those who did not. 25.6% among those with a low level of social support, compared to 5.4% among those with a high level of social support. By type of PPTE The PPTE types with the highest prevalence of screening positive for PTSD were: captivity (37.2%) sexual assault (28.9%) causing serious injury, harm or death to someone else (28.4%) * Respondents were also given the option to report a gender identity other than man or woman. Those who did so were excluded from all analyses for confidentiality reasons. Technical notes Potentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTEs) were assessed with a modified version of the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5).Footnote 2 Respondents were asked if they had directly or indirectly experienced each of a list of 17 PPTEs in their lifetime. Those who had experienced at least one PPTE were then asked about symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on the PPTE they identified as the worst they ever experienced. Screening positive for PTSD means scoring higher than 32 (out of 80) on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5),Footnote3 indicating moderate to severe symptoms of PTSD in the past month. While a diagnosis of PTSD requires a trained and licensed clinician, a validated screening tool such as the PCL-5 can identify individuals who may have PTSD but would need further assessment to confirm a diagnosis. Respondents in the Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events (SMHSE) were asked about conditions, including PTSD, that had been diagnosed by a health professional that had already lasted, or were expected to last, 6 months or more. A current diagnosis of PTSD means the individual currently has a PTSD diagnosis and a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD means the individual either currently has a PTSD diagnosis or had a PTSD diagnosis at some time in the past.
