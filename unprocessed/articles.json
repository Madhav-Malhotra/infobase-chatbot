Reducing child abuse, then, will not only reduce immediate pain, injury and suffering, but may also improve adults\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long-term physical health.\nChild maltreatment, including physical and sexual abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence, is a serious public health issue. The links between childhood abuse and teenagers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and adults\u00e2\u0080\u0099 psychological problems, such as suicidal ideation and attempts, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse, are well known [Afifi et al., 2014]; [Tonmyr & Shields, 2016]. Current research is focusing on the lesser known long-term consequences of child maltreatment and the development of chronic physical health conditions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChildhood experiences, both positive and negative, have a tremendous impact on future violence victimization and perpetration, and lifelong health and opportunity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [CDC, 2016]\n\nFindings from the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Study from the US support the link between adverse childhood experiences, and certain long-term chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes in adulthood. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis using the ACEs found that adverse childhood experiences, including physical abuse, sexual abuse or neglect, were associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adulthood.  This is thought to be due to ACEs acting as chronic stressors on the body by triggering elevated levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, glucose and insulin in the blood as well as other markers of inflammation. [Huang et al., 2015]\nStudies from Canada are showing similar findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we looked at\nSome people experience more severe child maltreatment than others. People might get hit once, or repeatedly, with or without dangerous objects.  Similarly, sexual abuse may happen only once or may continue, and may involve more or less intrusive acts.  New research allows the exploration and better understanding of the importance of severity to health outcomes later in life.\nThe 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mental Health (CCHS-MH) was nationally representative and included responses from over 25,000 Canadians.  A recent study based on the CCHS-MH [Shields et al., 2016] found that childhood maltreatment was associated with diabetes. In the survey, respondents were asked to report on long-term health conditions diagnosed by a health professional. Adults were also asked a series of questions about experiences of childhood physical or sexual abuse or exposure to intimate partner violence before they were 16 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we found\nThe study found that the frequency (e.g. if the abuse happened more than three times), the type of abuse (physical, sexual or both) and the severity of the abuse (e.g. punching, choking or burning) seemed to affect the risk of developing diabetes. Specifically the study found that:\n\nThose who frequently experienced severe childhood sexual abuse were twice as likely to have diabetes than those who did not experience childhood sexual abuse.\nExperiencing more than one type of childhood abuse increased the likelihood of having diabetes as an adult.\nThose who frequently experienced severe childhood physical and sexual abuse were over two times more likely to have diabetes than those who experienced no abuse of either type.\n\nTo verify the connection between childhood maltreatment and diabetes, we isolated the effects of other known factors that contribute to the risk of developing diabetes such as obesity, smoking status, physical activity level, high blood pressure, age, gender, and income. After this verification, the connection between childhood maltreatment and diabetes remained.\nFew studies have examined associations between childhood maltreatment and diabetes using large population-based samples. Therefore studies such as this one, of a representative sample of Canadian adults, are important in highlighting the life-long health consequences of experiencing family violence in childhood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this means for public health\nDiabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in Canada and increases the risk of developing a number of additional long-term health issues such as heart disease and stroke. The proportion of Canadians living with diabetes has almost doubled from 6% in 2000 to 10% in 2011. Understanding the role of childhood maltreatment as a risk factor for diabetes, and other life-long health issues, is needed in order to inform treatment of this illness. It also underscores the need to focus on both research and evidence based prevention efforts to address violence against children in the family setting. Working to reduce child maltreatment now could have positive mental and physical health implications for Canadians down the road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2017-02-21\n\n\n\n"

Trends of alcohol use among grade 7 to 12 Canadian students from the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS), formerly the Youth Smoking Survey (YSS), are also presented.\n\n\nCanadians 15 years of age and older\nCanadian students in grades 7 to 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout three quarters of Canadians report consuming alcohol in the past year (Figure 1)\n\nThe prevalence of past-12-month alcohol use remained relatively stable among Canadians, 15 years of age and older, ranging from 76% to 78% between 2008 and 2017.\nWhile the prevalence of past-12-month alcohol use has been relatively stable among males, it increased slightly among females between 2008 and 2017.\n                \nAmong females, the prevalence of past-12 month alcohol use increased slightly among those 25 years and older, while it remained stable among 20 to 24 year olds and declined by 17% among 15 to 19 year olds.\n\n\nThe prevalence of past-12-month alcohol use was highest among 20 to 24 year olds, ranging from 83% to 86% between 2008 and 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Many existing antimicrobial drugs, such as antibiotics, are becoming less effective at treating infections, and drug-resistant pathogens continue to emerge.\nResistance can develop naturally over time; however, the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine has greatly accelerated its emergence and spread across the human, animal and food chain. Antimicrobials are instrumental in medical advances and saving lives. Without effective antimicrobials, our ability to fight infectious diseases will significantly decline.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada integrates and synthesizes information from its various surveillance systems and laboratory reference services that cover human, animal and food to present data on antimicrobial resistance and use in the human (hospital and community) and animal settings. The full 2022 Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) report presents data between 2016 and 2021.\n\n\nAntimicrobial Resistance in Humans\nAntimicrobial resistance for most priority organisms continued to increase over a five-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infections: 2016-2020\n\nThe overall rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections increased, driven by increases in community-associated infections since 2017.\nNearly 1 in 6 (17.5%) patients diagnosed with MRSA BSI died within 30 days of diagnosis (all-cause mortality).\n\nFigure 1. Incidence rates of overall, healthcare-associated and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, CNISP, 2016-2020.\n\n\nTable 1.

About a third of Canadians (33.9%) reported antibiotic use in the past 12 months, 2021-2022.\n\nMore than 1 in 7 used antibiotics twice or more.\nClose to 1 in 20 used antibiotics more than five times.\n\nIn 2008, 38.0% of Canadians reported having taken antibiotics in the 12 months, showing that the proportion of Canadians reporting antibiotic use has declined slightly since then.\n\nFigure 6.

It provides a summary of antimicrobial consumption by antimicrobial class or AWaRe category using the last 12 months of data. The AWaRe categories are Access, Watch and Reserve. The WHO created this classification system to account for the impact of different antibiotics on antimicrobial resistance and to emphasize the importance of their appropriate use. These quantities are expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1,000 census inhabitants or prescriptions per 1,000 census inhabitants. A DDD refers to the assumed average maintenance dose per day in adults.\n\n\nHeatmap of antimicrobial consumption by\n                \nantimicrobial class\n\nAWaRe category\n\n(Updated: Octobber 23, 2023)\n\n\nHow to use the heatmap\n\n\n\n\nHovering over a cell reveals the number of DDDs or prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants for the selected antimicrobial category and corresponding province or region.

It affects Canadians of all ages, but younger Canadians are disproportionately affected.\nSymptoms of asthma include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. There is currently no cure for asthma; however, it can be well controlled by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, avoiding allergens and other triggers, quitting smoking, and taking medication properly. [PHAC Fact Sheet 2015]\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada works with all provinces and territories, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System, to collect and report national surveillance data on asthma.\nA new publication, titled Report from the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System: Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Canada, 2018, describes the burden of chronic respiratory diseases in Canada. Some of the report's highlights are presented in this blog.\n\n\n\n\n3.8 million\nThe number of Canadians living with diagnosed asthma reached 3.8 million (10.8%) in 2011/12. Approximately 820,000 people sought medical attention due to their asthma during the same year. [PHAC CCDSS 2018]\n67%\nThe proportion of Canadians living with diagnosed asthma increased by 67% between 2000/01 and 2011/12; from 2.1 million (6.5%) in 2000/01 to 3.8 million (10.8%) in 2011/12. On a positive note, the proportion of Canadians who needed medical attention due to their asthma declined by 18% during the same time period, from 908,000 (2.8%) in 2000/01 to 820,000 (2.3%) in 2011/12. [PHAC CCDSS 2018]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren vs. Adults\nAsthma disproportionately affects children and youth. In 2011/12, the proportion of children and youth living with diagnosed asthma was on average 62% greater than the proportion of adults (including seniors) diagnosed with the disease. [PHAC CDIIF 2016]\nWould you like to see these estimates by age-groups? Check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below. \nMen vs. Women\nDuring childhood and teenage years, asthma is more common among boys than among girls (18% vs. 13%). In adulthood however, a greater proportion of women are affected by the disease than men (11% vs. 8%). [PHAC CDIIF 2016]\nWould you like to see age-group specific estimates for males and females?

Because of the range of characteristics, this condition is named a \u00e2\u0080\u009cspectrum\u00e2\u0080\u009d disorder, where ones\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abilities and deficits can fall anywhere along a spectrum, and thereby, support needs may range from none to very substantial.  It is a complex life-long condition that impacts not only the person with ASD, but their families, caregivers and communities.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is working closely with provincial and territorial (P/T) partners on the National Autism Spectrum Disorder Surveillance System (NASS). The NASS provides national data on the number (i.e., prevalence) of children and youth ages 5-17 years living with ASD. Initial results have been published in the 2018 NASS report.  Findings are based on data collected from Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory and represent a total of 40% of all children and youth aged 5\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years across Canada.  \nSome of the key findings are summarized below. \n\n\n\n\n1 in 66\n1 in 66 children and youth (i.e., 15.2 per 1,000) 5\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years of age were diagnosed with ASD in 2015. The number of children and youth with ASD varied between provinces and territories from 1 in 126 to 1 in 57.Footnote\u00a02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoys vs Girls\nSigns of ASD are usually detected in early childhood. Males were identified with ASD four times more frequently at 1 in 42 (i.e., 23.9 per 1,000) than females at 1 in 165 (i.e., 6.0 per 1,000).Footnote\u00a02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 years\nAmong those diagnosed by 17 years of age, 56% had received their diagnosis by 6 years of age; almost three-quarters (i.e., 72%) had been diagnosed by 8 years of age; and less than 10% were diagnosed after 12 years of age.Footnote\u00a02\n\n\n\nCanada and United States comparison\nThe United States (U.S.) and Canada use different methods to estimate the prevalence of autism.  In the U.S., data on 8 year old children with autism are captured in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network.  In 2012, the most recent year for which data are reported, records from multiple sources were reviewed from 11 different network sites. Records were reviewed by a healthcare professional to determine if a child has a diagnosis of ASD and/or behaviours consistent with ASD.  Despite the differences in methods between Canada and the U.S., the results from these two tracking systems are quite similar with the prevalence of ASD among 8 year olds being 1 in 63 in Canada (2015) and 1 in 68 in the US (2012). \n\nReferences:\n\n Footnote 1 \n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Each death becomes part of a vital statistics mortality dataset. Death data in Canada is categorized using a classification system entitled International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision, commonly known as ICD-10.  The ICD-10 classification system categorizes cause of death data into 22 groups referred to as chapters. Each chapter contains numerous sub-groups.\nA series of letters and numbers designates each chapter as part of the classification scheme (see links below to the ICD-10 classification system). For example, if the primary cause of death is cancer of the body of the stomach, it would be recorded as a cancer death in Chapter 2, Neoplasms and receive a code of C16.2.  The interactive diagram below shows the number and proportion of Canadians in 2015, by age group, that died from causes in each of the various chapters. Three chapters had no deaths and were excluded below.\nIt is important to note that every death captured in the data below has been attributed to one underlying cause - the immediate cause of death. However, in the majority of cases, several conditions or diseases are involved. For example, diabetes can contribute to a death attributed to heart attack, and depression can contribute to a death related to suicide. In the future, multiple-cause-of death data will allow us to explore the broader factors involved in mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber and Percentage of Deaths in Canada by Age Group, 2015  In the figure below for each age group, the stacked coloured bars represent disease chapters. To display a detailed description, hover over or tab to any specific disease chapter in the graph or the legend.

Over that time period, the number of deaths per year increased for external causes, cancer, mental and behavioural disorders, and diseases of the nervous, respiratory and digestive systems. Except in 2015, deaths due to infectious diseases increased as well. Of note, circulatory disease deaths had been decreasing for a number of years, with slight increases from 2012 to 2015 compared to 2011.

Across North America, May and June are the designated Bike to Work months. Annually, throughout spring, cities across Canada hold a Bike to Work Week or Day. For everyone who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to dust off their bikes this spring, we want to tell you about BikeMaps.org - use it to plan your routes and avoid traffic, in order to stay safe and improve your health!\nBut first, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModes of Transportation\nAccording to the 2011 census, of 15.4 million workers travelling to and from their place of work, approximately:\n12.3 million people drive\n1.9 million use public transportation\n900 000 walk\n200 000 bike\n[2011 Census]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2%\nBiking to work is a great way to reach the recommended amount of physical activity (150 minutes a week). Right now, only 22.2% of Canadians are reaching it. [Physical Activity Guidelines]\n44.4%\nHaving a workplace that facilitates active transportation is important. For example, 44.4% of Canadian adults say they have access to a shower in their workplaces. Having access to showers and change rooms is a supportive resource for those wanting to bike to work or engage in lunch-time physical activity. [Physical Activity Guidelines]\n15 min x 2\nDid you know that it only takes a 15 minute bike ride twice a day, five days a week to meet your weekly amount of active time? Even if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bike every day, using active transportation can be a solid foundation for getting your weekly physical activity. Make better use of the time that you would have otherwise spent in traffic! [Physical Activity Guidelines]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is BikeMaps.org?\nRecently, the Public Health Agency of Canada funded the Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF) to expand BikeMaps.org: A citizen web-mapping surveillance tool for safe and accessible bicycling and healthy living promotion.\nBikeMaps.org is an interactive mapping tool used by riders in different cities around Canada and the world. Riders can record places around their city where there have been collisions or where they feel other riders should be cautious (near-misses). It lets you plan your route to avoid dangerous areas. As May is Bike to Work month, safety is top of mind. Apps like the one produced by BikeMaps.org are extremely useful to keep all riders safe.

During this time, international travellers entering Canada at air or land borders had to meet various COVID-19 testing requirements. The number and types of tests required depended on the requirements in place at the time. The CBTP test result data includes arrival and post-entry test results.\nYou can use this dashboard to track and compare the percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive among international travellers entering Canada.\nRefer to the Timeline for the entry rules and testing requirements in place at different times throughout the program.\nRefer to Definitions for detailed explanations of some of the terms used on this page.\n\nNumber of tests: February 22, 2021 to September 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\n5,808,014\n\n\nTotal tests\n\n\n\n\n130,935\n\n\nTotal positive tests\n\n\n\n\nAbout the number of tests\nTotal tests is the number of arrival and post-entry tests taken by international travellers as part of the CBTP.

However, some samples collected during the weeks leading up to September 30 may not have been processed by labs in time to meet this deadline. Test positivity for the final 2 weeks of September should be interpreted with this understanding.\n                    \nEach shaded box represents a distinct phase, or time period.

Published:   (2020-09-21)\nCanada is covered with 347 million hectares of forest, making up 9% of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total forest area. With so many forested areas, wildfires are a serious risk for Canadians, particularly from May to September. Large, destructive fires can quickly spread out of control. They occur most commonly in British Columbia, the Prairies, and parts of Ontario and Quebec. The smoke produced from such wildfires significantly affects air quality, which can increase several health risks. Wildfire smoke contains small particles from burned material, such as wood and plants, and harmful gases. Winds can carry the harmful smoke far past the initial wildfire, affecting communities thousands of kilometers away.\n\n\n\nAssessing wildfire impact\nThe Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool (AQBAT) is a computer application developed by scientists at Health Canada and used to estimate the health impacts caused by changes in outdoor air quality. Epidemiologist Dr. Dave Stieb and other scientists use AQBAT to examine the human health impacts of actions proposed to reduce outdoor air pollution and to estimate the health burden associated with air pollution.\nAQBAT uses population, health outcome and pollutant concentration data to predict the health impacts to Canadians from changes in outdoor air quality, including wildfires. Collaborators from Environment and Climate Change Canada use a model called FireWork to estimate the impact of wildfires on air quality, which is then loaded into AQBAT to estimate the mortality rate and other health impacts specifically caused by wildfire smoke.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy using these predictive tools, we can take proactive steps to reduce the risks of mortality and other health impacts caused by wildfire smoke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Stieb. He and Dr. Carlyn Matz are authors of a health impact analysis of wildfire smoke in Canada.\nHundreds of thousands of people per year experience adverse health impacts, and some may even die, due to wildfire smoke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnderstanding the health impacts of wildfires is important as climate change is expected to increase wildfire frequency and season length,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Matz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis map shows the mortality rate attributed to wildfire smoke in Canada in 2018. British Columbia was affected the most by fires that year. However, AQBAT analysis indicates the impacts also extended into Alberta, as well as Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories.The mortality rate (per 100,000) attributed to wildfire smoke in the Ottawa census district in 2018 was 0.04.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the data (.csv)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying safe under fire\nWildfire smoke and its subsequent effects on outdoor air quality pose several health risks. The harmful particles and gases in the smoke cause respiratory problems when inhaled. Those with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma are especially at risk, as the smoke can worsen these conditions. Symptoms of smoke inhalation include congestion, headaches, watery or irritated eyes, coughing, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. While those closest to the fire are at a higher risk than those farther away, smoke can still travel thousands of kilometres with the wind and have impacts far from the source.\nThere are many ways to protect yourself and others during wildfires. Prepare for wildfire season by ensuring you have enough medication for any health conditions. It is important to stay informed about wildfires by listening to the news or to local authorities. If an evacuation becomes necessary, be prepared with a plan and follow the instructions of authorities. \nIf an evacuation isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessary, you can also take steps to stay safe in your home. If possible, filter the air in your home using an air conditioner or a HEPA filter. You should avoid going outdoors during smoke events or when the outdoor air quality is poor. Consider going to a location with cleaner air, such as a shopping mall or library. If you must go outside, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Quality Benefits Assessment Tool \nProviding valuable information about wildfire smoke is just one example of what the AQBAT can do to keep Canadians informed and healthy. AQBAT is the go-to application used to predict the benefits (positive impacts) or damages (negative impacts) of proposed outdoor air quality regulations, and is the key tool for examining the impacts of outdoor air pollution in Canada.Find out more about AQBAT and air quality research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2023-06-09\n\n\n\n"

Information on 24 different categories of cancer types, including overall cancer, are available. The Public Health Agency of Canada developed this tool using Statistic Canada\u2019s Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR) and Canadian Vital Statistics Death (CVSD) database. Data for the CCR and CVSD databases are obtained from provincial and territorial cancer and vital statistics registries.

Changes in such measures may be driven by multiple factors, including (but not limited to) differences in healthcare seeking behaviour, the availability and use of healthcare services, as well as true changes in health status.  As such, CCDSS measures should be used cautiously when making inferences about population health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidance for data users on examining the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCDSS measures can be accessed below.Data suppression: Estimates, rates and rate ratios are not reported when the counts are less than 10 or the coefficient of variation is greater than 33.3%.Due to periodic updates of the historical surveillance data, estimates for a particular disease and year may change over time, and may not be comparable to previous editions. Estimates and rates are age-standardized to the 2011 Canadian population\u00a0using unrounded counts and five-year age groups.Nunavut data are excluded before 2005\u20132006.Newfoundland and Labrador data are excluded before 2008\u20132009. Yukon data are excluded before 2010\u20132011.  The modernization of the Quebec billing system for fee-for-service medical services by the R\u00e9gie de l'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (RAMQ) in 2016 has resulted in a decrease in the entry of diagnostic codes in the fee-for-service medical services file. Data for 2016\u20132017 and subsequent years should therefore be interpreted with caution, as a slight underestimation is suspected. Nova Scotia data among individuals aged 1\u201319 are excluded.Northwest Territories data were not available.New Brunswick data were not available for 2021-2022.Saskatchewan data were not available for 2021-2022.\nSource: Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System 2023Methods: CCDSS Summary of Methods Case definitions: CCDSS Case Definitions COVID-19 Documentation: CCDSS COVID-19 guidance for data users\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\n\n\r\n                                These data were made possible through collaboration between PHAC and the respective provincial and territorial governments of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

The 2019-2020 version of this report has been archived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nData tables\nTechnical notes\n\n\nSummary\nData tables\nTechnical notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Canada monitors the prevalence of substance use and its impact on postsecondary students through the Canadian Postsecondary Education Alcohol and Drug Use Survey (CPADS). Governments and non-governmental organizations use this information to shape policies and programs that address substance use and support students.\nCPADS 2021-22 marks the survey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second cycle. To view results from the initial survey cycle, refer to CPADS 2019-20.\n\n\n\nAbout CPADS 2021-22\n\n\n\n\n\nCPADS 2021-22 recruited postsecondary students who were studying online or in person at a Canadian university, college, or CEGEP and living in Canada. A total of 40,931 respondents of all ages and programs completed online surveys between November 29, 2021 and April 19, 2022 across all 10 provinces.\nThe survey asks students about the following substances:\n\nAlcohol\nCannabis\nPsychoactive pharmaceuticals (pain relievers, sedatives, and stimulants)\nIllegal drugs (such as heroin and cocaine)\nTobacco and vaping products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis report presents national and gender-specific results (women, men, transgender/non-binary). Where harms are known to differ based on sex-based physiological differences, results by sex (female, male) are reported instead of by gender.\nThere are several differences between the first and second CPADS cycles. While CPADS 2019-20 included undergraduate students aged 17 to 25 attending classes in-person, the 2021-22 survey added students of all ages and in all programs, regardless of program delivery (i.e., online, in-person, and mixed delivery). To increase comparability between the two cycles, the 2021-22 results reported below pertain specifically to 17 to 25 year olds and comparisons to the 2019-20 cycle are made where relevant. CPADS 2021-22 is the first to examine substance use according to self-reported mental health.\nThe Technical notes tab includes definition of terms, data suppression rules, and other information helpful to interpreting the data.\nAll results are available in the Data Tables tab, reported by \u00e2\u0080\u009coverall\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\nThe key findings below report differences between survey cycles or genders (\u00e2\u0080\u009cincreased\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecreased\u00e2\u0080\u009d) only when these are statistically significant with at least a small effect size1. For greater readability, the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cstatistically significant\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the effect size are not repeated. At times, the text states \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere were no meaningful differences\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though the numbers are not identical. This indicates the difference is not statistically significant and/or the effect size is so trivial as to have little or no influence on the variable being reported.\n\n\nAbout the students\nThe findings below pertain specifically to respondents aged 17 to 25 years enrolled in any program at a university, college, or CEGEP \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a total of 31,643 students (from the 40,931 total survey responses) who self-identified as women (61%), men (35%) and transgender/non-binary (4%). With regard to campus attendance, 30% of these students studied in-person, 21% online, and 48% reported a mix of in-person and online.\nResults\n\n\nAlcohol\n\n\nFigure \n1.

Alcohol protective behaviours \"usually\" or \"always\" used in the past 30 days [among past 12 month drinkers] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past 12 months, 79% of students drank alcohol. Drinking in the past 12 months was similar across gender groups.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Text Description\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Females were significantly more likely than males to have consumed alcohol in the past 12 months.\n2 Students in third year or higher were significantly more likely than students in 1st or 2nd year to have consumed alcohol in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nKey alcohol findings: Postsecondary students reported consuming alcohol more than any other substance. Nearly half of all students reported heavy drinking, while 1 in 6 were aware of drinking guidelines. Compared to CPADS 2019-20, alcohol-related harms decreased among postsecondary students, as did alcohol consumption. Since the onset of COVID-19, approximately one third of students reported the quantity and frequency of their alcohol consumption decreased, most often due to fewer social gatherings. Among the approximately one third who reported drinking more since the onset of COVID-19, the top reason was boredom.\nDetailed alcohol findings\n\nEighty-five percent (85%) of students had consumed alcohol  in their lifetime; 79% had consumed alcohol in the past 12 months, while 64% had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days (decreased from 74% in 2019-20). There were no meaningful differences by gender.\nAmong all students, 30% reported drinking once per week or more often in the past 30 days (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender).\nAmong all students, 1 in 6 (17%) had heard of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2011 Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelinesi (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Students were asked about the 2011 Guidelines specifically, as these were the ones in place while data was being collected.\nAmong students who drank in the past 30 days, the most common alcoholic beverages consumed were spirits and liquors (63%), followed by wine (57%) and beer (51%).\nForty-five percent (45%) of all students had consumed alcohol in a pattern consistent with heavy drinking in the past 30 days (decreased from 57% in 2019-20). When analyzed by sex, there were no meaningful differences.\nSixty-four percent (64%) of students who drank in the past 30 days reported feeling drunk at least once over this period (decreased from 74% in 2019-20). When analyzed by gender, there were no meaningful differences.\nAmong those who drank alcohol in the past 30 days, men were more likely to report feeling drunk once a week or more (at 23%), compared to women (15%) and individuals identifying as transgender/non-binary (15%).\nAmong students who drank alcohol within the past 12 months, 47% experienced at least 1 alcohol-related harm in the past month (decreased from 56% in 2019-20). When analyzed by gender, there were no meaningful differences. Students reported most often that they experienced a hangover (27%), had less energy or felt tired (20%), drank on nights when they planned not to (17%), said or did something embarrassing (16%), or felt sick to their stomach or threw up (14%). Respondents could select more than 1 harm.\nSeventeen percent (17%) of all students reported experiencing at least 1 harm within the past month because of another student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking (decreased from 31% in 2019-20). When analyzed by gender, there were no meaningful differences. The secondary harms most often reported were the need to take care of another student (7%), that their sleep was affected (7%), another student upset or disappointed them (6%), that their studies were interrupted (4%) and that another student caused an argument with them (3%).\nAlmost all students (97%) who consumed alcohol in the past 30 days employed protective strategies \u00e2\u0080\u009calways\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cusually\u00e2\u0080\u009d to slow down alcohol consumption, avoid intoxication, and prevent dangerous alcohol-related consequences (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender).\nAmong those who drank in the past 12 months, 11% reported driving within 2 hours of consuming at least 2 drinks (no meaningful difference between cycles). Men (at 15%) were more likely to drive within 2 hours of consuming drinks than women (8%). Fifteen percent (15%) of students reported ever being a passenger with a driver who had recently consumed alcohol.\nAmong those who drank in the past 12 months, 40% reported the quantity of alcohol they consumed remained the same since the COVID-19 pandemic, while 30% reported they consumed less alcohol and 30% reported consuming more. Similarly, 37% of students reported consuming alcohol at the same frequency, while 34% consumed less frequently and 28% more frequently.\nThe top reasons reported for more alcohol consumption during COVID-19 were boredom (47%), more social gatherings online or at home (43%), lack of a regular schedule (39%), depression/low mood (33%) and stress (32%). The top reasons reported for drinking less alcohol were fewer social gatherings online or at home (79%), trying to save money (16%), living at home with parents (14%), depression/low mood (9%) and lack of a regular schedule (9%).\n\n\n\n\nCannabis\n\n\nFigure \n9. Past 12 month cannabis use \n10. Past 30 day cannabis use \n11. Frequency of cannabis consumption in the past 30 days \n12. Cannabis products used in the past 12 months [among past 12 month users] \n\n\n\n\nWithin the past 12 months, 43% of all respondents had used cannabis. Past year use of cannabis was greater among transgender/non-binary respondents (55% vs. 43% among women and 42% among men).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Text Description\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than men to have used cannabis in the past 12 months.\n2 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than women to have used cannabis in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nKey cannabis findings: Overall, prevalence and frequency of cannabis consumption did not meaningfully change among postsecondary students compared to CPADS 2019-20. Cannabis use was notably higher among transgender/non-binary students compared to men and women. In terms of sourcing cannabis, there was a notable increase in the number of students reporting they obtained it from a legal storefront. As for cannabis products of choice, edibles remained the most common type (no notable change between cycles), while use of dried flower/leaf decreased and use of vaping pens and cannabis beverages increased. Among students who used cannabis in the previous 12 months, nearly half reported an increase in both the quantity and frequency of use since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the top reason being boredom. At the same time, there was a notable decrease in students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 awareness of educational campaigns or public health messaging related to cannabis health risks.\nDetailed cannabis findings\n\nIn the past 12 months, 43% of students had used cannabis (no meaningful difference between cycles). Past 12-month cannabis use was higher among transgender/non-binary students (55%) than women (43%) and men (42%).\nTwenty-nine percent (29%) of students had used cannabis in the past 30 days (no meaningful difference between cycles). Past 30-day cannabis use was higher among transgender/non-binary students (42%) than women (29%) and men (29%).\nEight percent (8%) of students consumed cannabis on a daily or almost daily basis (5 or more days per week), with no meaningful difference between cycles. Daily or almost daily use of cannabis in the past 30 days was higher among transgender/non-binary students (14%) than men (8%) and women (7%).\nAmong students who had used cannabis in the past 12 months: \n                            \nThe most common types of cannabis products used were edibles (62%; no meaningful difference between cycles), dried flower/leaf (60%; decreased from 74% in 2019-20), vape pens (50%; increased from 40% in 2019-20), cannabis oil for oral use (20%; no meaningful difference between cycles) and cannabis beverages (18%; increased from 3% in 2019-20).\nThe top sources to obtain cannabis were from a legal storefront (63%; increased from 34% in 2019-20), from a friend (14%; decreased from 25% in 2019-20), shared among friends (8%; decreased from 14% in 2019-20) and from a legal online source (5%; no meaningful difference between cycles).\n\n\nAmong students who had used cannabis in the past 12 months, 23% reported that they had driven within 2 hours of smoking or vaporizing cannabis (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender). Almost a third (29%) of all students reported being a passenger in a vehicle driven by someone who recently used cannabis (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender).\nAmong those who reported using cannabis in the past 3 months, scores from the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST - see Key definitions) indicated that 31% were at low risk of health and other problems from their current pattern of use, while 62% were at moderate risk. Eight percent (8%) were at high risk of experiencing severe problems, and likely to have a substance dependence (no meaningful differences between cycles or by gender).\nStudents were asked if they had seen or heard education campaigns or public health or safety messages about cannabis in various locations since the Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018. Twenty-one percent (21%) reported that they had not noticed any such campaigns or messages (increased from 7% in 2019-20; no meaningful difference by gender). The most common locations for students to have seen or heard these messages were on social media (58%), at school (41%), publicly displayed posters or billboards (32%), and TV/radio (32%).\nAmong students who consumed cannabis in the past 12 months, 79% reported using it in combination with another substance, most commonly with alcohol (75%; no meaningful difference between cycles or by gender), followed by tobacco or an e-cigarette with nicotine (23%; decreased from 42% in 2019-20). Men (28%) reported using cannabis in combination with tobacco or an e-cigarette with nicotine more than women (18%), though there were no meaningful differences between transgender/non-binary students (at 22%) and men or women.\nAmong those who had used cannabis in the past 12 months, 47% reported the quantity they consumed had increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, while 34% reported consuming the same amount, and 18% reported consuming less. Similarly, 46% of students reported consuming cannabis more frequently, while 34% consumed at the same frequency and 20% consumed less.\nThe top reasons reported for more cannabis consumption during COVID-19 were boredom (63%), stress (48%), anxiety (48%), depression/low mood (46%), and lack of a regular schedule (43%). The top reasons reported for consuming less cannabis were fewer social gatherings online or at home (44%), anxiety (17%), living at home with parents (16%), trying to save money (13%), and depression/low mood (11%).\n\n\n\n\nPsychoactive pharmaceutical use\n\n\nFigure \n13. Past 12 month use of psychoactive pharmaceuticals (pain relievers, stimulants, sedatives) \n14. Higher-risk use\u00b9 of psychoactive pharmaceuticals among ever-users \n\n\n\n\nOverall, 37% of respondents used at least one opioid pain reliever, stimulant, or sedative in the past 12 months (increased from 36% in 2019-20). A quarter (25%) used pain relievers, 11% used stimulants and 10% used sedatives.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Text Description\n\n\n\n\n\nAll reported differences are statistically significant (p<=0.05) and have a meaningful effect size (h>=0.2).\n1 Women were more likely than men to use all classes of pharmaceuticals in the past 12 months.\n2 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than men to use all classes of pharmaceuticals in the past 12 months.\n3 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than women to use stimulants and sedatives in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nKey psychopharmaceutical findings: Overall, psychoactive pharmaceutical use among postsecondary students remains high with more than a third of students reporting use. Some of the reasons for use are unique to this population (for example, using stimulants to help cram for exams).\nDetailed psychopharmaceutical findings\n\nA quarter of students (25%) reported using opioid pain relievers in the past 12 months (no meaningful difference between cycles or by gender).\nOverall, 37% of students used at least 1 opioid pain reliever, stimulant, or sedative in the past 12 months (no meaningful difference between cycles). Transgender/non-binary students (52%) reported higher rates of psychoactive pharmaceutical use than women (41%) and men (32%).\nAmong those who had ever used stimulants, 34% had used them in a higher-risk way in the past 12 months (decreased from 60% in 2019-20, no meaningful difference be gender). This was more than higher-risk use of opioid pain relievers (25%) and sedatives (15%).\nAmong those who used pharmaceuticals in the past 12 months for reasons other than prescribed, the main reason for each pharmaceutical product was: to help them sleep (opioid pain relievers at 42%; no meaningful difference between cycles), to get high/for the feeling they caused (sedatives at 67%; no meaningful difference between cycles) and to cram for exams (stimulants at 45%; decreased from 56% in 2019-20).\n                            \nWomen (50%) and transgender/non-binary students (44%) used opioid pain relievers to help them sleep more than men (32%).\nTransgender/non-binary students (78%) used sedatives to get high/for the feeling they caused more than men (70%) and women (64%).\nMen (47%) and women (45%) used stimulants to help them cram for exams more than transgender/non-binary students (16%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllegal drug use\n\n\nFigure 15. Past 12 month use of illegal drugs\n\n\nApproximately 12% of participants reported using at least one illegal drug during the past 12 months (decreased from 15% in 2019-20). Use of illegal drugs was higher overall among transgender/non-binary students than among men and women.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Text Description\n\n\n\n\n\nAll reported differences are statistically significant (p<=0.05) and have a meaningful effect size (h>=0.2).\n* Moderate sampling variability, interpret with caution.\n# High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed.\n1 Includes: Cocaine or crack, non-prescription amphetamines, methamphetamines, ecstasy or similar designer drugs, salvia, hallucinogens, sniffed glue, gasoline or other solvents, heroin, synthetic cannabinoids, mephedrone, BZP/TFMPP.\n2 Transgender/non-binary students were more likely than women to have used this drug in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nKey illegal drug finding: Approximately 1 in 10 postsecondary students reported illegal drug use, most commonly \u00e2\u0080\u009cparty\u00e2\u0080\u009d drugs such as hallucinogens, cocaine, and ecstasy.\nDetailed illegal drug findings\n\nStudents were asked if they had ever used or tried any of the following 11 illegal drugs: cocaine or crack; non-prescription amphetamines; methamphetamine; ecstasy or others similar designer/club drugs; hallucinogens; heroin; sniffed glue, gasoline or other solvents; salvia; synthetic cannabinoids; mephedrone; and BZP/TFMPP. Twelve percent (12%) reported using at least 1 of these substances in the past 12 months (no meaningful difference between cycles). By gender, more transgender/non-binary students (19%) reported illegal drug use than women (10%), though there were no meaningful differences between men (at 14%) and women or transgender/non-binary students.\nAmong all students, the illegal drugs most reported to be used were hallucinogens (8%), cocaine (4%), and ecstasy or similar designer drugs (3%), with no meaningful differences between cycles. By gender, transgender/non-binary students (at 16%) reported using hallucinogens more than men (10%) and women (6%), with no meaningful differences in use of cocaine or ecstasy or similar designer drugs.\n\n\n\n\nSmoking and Vaping\n\n\nFigure \n16. Current smoking status \n17. Frequency of vaping and e-cigarette use in the past 30 days \n\n\n\n\nNearly a quarter (23%) of students reported ever smoking at least a whole cigarette. In the past 30 days, 2% of all students reported smoking daily, while 92% reported not smoking at all.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Text Description\n\n\n\n\n\n* Moderate sampling variability, interpret with caution.\n\n\n\nKey smoking and vaping finding: A minority of students reported daily use of cigarettes (at 2%) or vaping/e-cigarette products (8%).\nDetailed smoking and vaping findings\n\nEight percent (8%) of all students reported any cigarette use in the past 30 days. Daily cigarette use during the past 30 days was reported by 2% of all students (cannot compare cycles; no meaningful differences by gender).\nIn these findings, vaping includes both e-liquid with nicotine and without nicotine (just flavouring). E-cigarettes include all e-cigarettes, vape mods, vaporizers, and vape pens. Vaping cannabis is excluded. Seventeen percent (17%) of all students reported any vaping or e-cigarette use in the past 30 days. Daily vaping or e-cigarette use during the past 30 days was reported by 8% of students (cannot compare cycles; no meaningful differences by gender).\n\n\n\n\nSubstance use and self-reported mental health\n\nMental health was self-reported by students. Responses of \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcellent\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery good\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d are referred to collectively as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood mental health\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Responses of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor\u00e2\u0080\u009d are referred to collectively as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor mental health\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nKey mental health findings: Almost half of students reported poor mental health, though this differed by gender. Students with poor mental health were more likely to consume cannabis, stimulants, and sedatives. In comparison to students with good mental health, those with poor mental health were more likely to have increased the amount of alcohol and cannabis they used since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDetailed mental health findings\n\nOverall, 45% of postsecondary students reported poor mental health. Transgender/non-binary students (77%) reported poor mental health more than women (50%) or men (36%).\nStudents with poor mental health were more likely than those with good mental health to report past 12-month use of cannabis (52% vs. 36%), stimulants (15% vs. 8%), and sedatives (15% vs. 5%).\n                            \nAmong both women and men, students with poor mental health were more likely to report past 12-month use of cannabis and sedatives. Among women, those with poor mental health were more likely to report use of stimulants than those with good mental health.\n\n\nOverall, students with poor mental health were more likely to report increasing the quantity of both alcohol (36%) and cannabis (55%) they consume since the onset of COVID-19 (March 2020) than those with good mental health (24% for alcohol and 38% for cannabis).\n                            \nMen and women with poor mental health were also more likely to have reported increased consumption of cannabis in combination with alcohol since the start of COVID-19 than those of the same gender with good mental health.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThese data were made possible through collaboration with 45 postsecondary institutions across Canada.

The main goals of SCS are to help prevent overdose deaths, facilitate entry into addiction treatment programs, reduce the spread of bloodborne infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C), and reduce the strain on emergency medical services.\nFor more information on supervised consumption sites, please visit Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supervised Consumption Sites and Services page.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 million visits\n\nCanadian SCS saw around 4.3 million visits between 2017 and June 2023.\nCurrently (September 2023), with 39 sites operating, it is estimated that around 2,700 visits take place every day. The busiest SCS in Canada see upwards of 400 visits each day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49,000 overdoses and medical emergencies\n\nCanadian SCS attended to around 49,000 overdoses and drug-related medical emergencies between 2017 and June 2023, with no reported fatalities on-site.\nSCS staff also provide on-site harm reduction counselling to clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 361,000 unique clients\n\nBased on the data available, it is estimated that at least 361,000 Canadians had sought services provided by SCS between 2017 and June 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Prior to March 2020, the data wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely standardized.\nNumber of clients: The true number of unique clients visiting the sites between 2017 and June 2023 is difficult to estimate. Anonymous visits and inconsistent reporting by the sites make it difficult to derive a precise and accurate estimate. The number of unique clients is based on the number of different people using a site during the monthly reporting period. A person will only be counted once by a site each month, but the same person could be counted more than once when looking at data covering a period longer than one month.\nNumber of referrals: The true number of referrals made by Canadian SCS between 2017 and June 2023 is difficult to estimate due to inconsistencies in how the sites defined and reported the number of referrals they made.\nIn addition to SCS, there are numerous Urgent Public Health Need Sites (UPHNS)/Overdose Prevention Sites (OPS) operating across Canada. The numbers presented in this publication do not include data from UPHNS/OPS.\n\n\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpioid- and Stimulant-related Harms in Canada\nThe most recent available data on overdoses and deaths involving opioids and/or stimulants in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug Analysis Service and Cannabis Laboratories\nHealth Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Drug Analysis Service (DAS) operates laboratories across Canada that analyze suspected illegal drugs seized by Canadian law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n\nAll Health Infobase data products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find what you were looking for?\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nIf not, tell us why:\n\n\nWhat was wrong?\nAnswers to frequently asked questions can be found in the Understanding the data section!\n\n\n\n                                                The answer I need is missing\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                The information isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the right place\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                Something is broken or incorrect\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                Other reason\n                                            \n\n\nPlease provide more details\n\n(Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include any personal information.

PHAC works closely with the Canadian Cancer Society, Statistics Canada, provinces and territories, and other partners to provide annual statistics to inform cancer prevention and control in Canada. \nSome of the latest findings:\n\n\n\n\n565 per day\nEvery day an average of 565 Canadians are diagnosed with cancer while 220 Canadians will die from it. [CCS 2017]\n1 in 2\nAbout 1 in 2 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime. [CCS 2017]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 4\nFifty percent of all new cancer cases are one of the following: lung, breast, colorectal or prostate. [CCS 2017]\n30%\nCancer is responsible for 30% of all deaths in Canadians. [CCS 2017]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50+\nAlmost 90% of Canadians who develop cancer are 50 years or older. [CCS 2017]\nMen vs. Women\nIn 2017, nearly equal number of men (103,100) and women (103,200) were diagnosed with cancer in Canada. [CCS 2017]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-year survival rates\nThe percentage of Canadians surviving at least five-years following their cancer diagnosis has improved over a 16 year period (1992-2008) from 53% to 60% for all cancers combined. [CCS 2017]\n\n\n\nWhy 5 years?\nThe 5-year survival rate is a measure that estimates the percentage of people alive 5 years after their cancer diagnosis, whether they are disease-free, in remission, or still having treatment. Many of these people will survive much longer\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially if the cancer is detected and treated early. For example, if the 5-year survival rate for a specific cancer is 90% it means that people who have that cancer are about 90% as likely to live for at least 5 years after diagnosis compared to people in the general population.\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2018-01-22\n\n\n\n"

To help evaluate the impact of the legalization and regulation of cannabis, Health Canada has been conducting the annual Canadian Cannabis Survey (CCS) since 2018 to better understand how Canadians view and use cannabis. This data blog presents data from the past 6 years of the CCS. The 2018 cycle was conducted pre-legalization and the other 5 cycles were conducted post-legalization. To document changes over time, comparisons to 2018 are presented; in cases where a question was added after 2018, comparisons are made to the first year the question was asked. Findings are also compared to the previous survey cycle (2022)Footnote 1Footnote 2. Key findings on cannabis use for non-medical purposes from 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 are presented to examine self-reported changes since legalization and regulationFootnote 1Footnote 2. All results refer to cannabis use for non-medical purposes among Canadians aged 16 years and older.\n\n\n\n\n\nCannabis use\n\n\nMore than a quarter of Canadians reported cannabis use in the past 12 monthsFootnote 3\n\nPast 12-month cannabis use in 2023 (26%) increased from 2018 (22%).\n\nExplore the data in Figure 2\nApproximately 1 in 6 Canadians reported cannabis use in the past 30 daysFootnote 3\n\nPast 30-day cannabis use increased from 15% in 2018 to 17% in 2023, and decreased from 19% in 2022 to 17% in 2023.\nIn 2023, past 30-day use remained higher among males (19%, unchanged from 19% in 2018) than among females (15%, an increase from 11% in 2018).\nIn 2023, past 30-day use remained higher among Canadians aged 16-19 years (29%, an increase from 23% in 2018) and 20-24 years (31%, unchanged from 30% in 2018) than among people age 25+ (15%, an increase from 13% in 2018).\n\nFrequency of daily or almost daily cannabis use remained unchanged\n\nSix percent (6%) of all Canadians reported using cannabis daily or almost daily, unchanged from 5% in 2018 and a decrease from 7% in 2022.\n\t\t\t\t        \nThis represented 23% of Canadians who reported using cannabis in the past 12 months, unchanged from 25% in both 2018 and 2022.\n\n\nIn 2023, daily/almost daily use remained higher among males (7%, unchanged from 7% in 2018) than among females (5%, an increase from 4% in 2018).\nIn 2023 daily/almost daily use remained higher among Canadians aged 16-19 years (9%, unchanged from 7% in 2018) and 20-24 years (11%, unchanged from 12% in 2018) than among people age 25+ (5.3%, an increase from 4.6% in 2018).\n\nWhile cannabis smoking decreased, it remained the most common consumption method\n\nSmoking cannabis decreased from 89% in 2018 and 70% in 2022 to 63% in 2023.\nEating/drinking cannabis increased from 43% in 2018 to 55% in 2023 and remained stable between 2022  and 2023.\nVaping cannabis (including vaping dried cannabis and/or liquid or solid cannabis extracts) was unchanged between 2018 and 2023 and decreased between 2022 (36%) and 2023 (33%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCannabis sourcing\n\n\n\nMore Canadians purchased cannabis from a legal source\n\nIn 2023, 73% of those who reported using cannabis in the past 12 months reported usually purchasing their cannabis from a legal source (storefront or website), an increase from 4% in 2018 and 69% in 2022.\n\t\t\t\t        \nThis included 67% who reported purchasing from a legal storefront (up from 61% in 2022) and 5% who reported purchasing from a legal website (down from 8% in 2022).\n\n\nFifteen percent (15%) of people reported obtaining their cannabis from a social source (shared around a group of friends, from a friend, family member or acquaintance), a decrease from 2018 (60%) and 2022 (18%).\nFive percent (5%) reported growing their own cannabis or having it specifically grown for them, a decrease from 2018 (7%) and 2022 (8%).\nOnly 3% of people reported purchasing from an illegal source (illegal store, illegal website or dealer), down from 2018 (28%) and unchanged from 2022 (4%).\nTwo percent (2%) reported getting their cannabis from a storefront located in a First Nations community (new in 2023).\n\nExplore the data in Figure 3\nAverage monthly spending on cannabis in the past 12 months decreased since 2018\n\nThe amount typically spent per month on cannabis decreased from $73 in 2018 to $63 in 2023 and was unchanged between 2022 ($65) and 2023 ($63).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge and attitudes\n\n\n\nCanadians who had used cannabis are more likely to believe it can be habit-forming but less likely to endorse other risks\n\nApproximately 7 out of 10 (69%) Canadians reported \u00e2\u0080\u0098somewhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098strongly\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agreeing that they had enough trustworthy information about the health risks of cannabis use to make informed decisions, a decrease compared to both 2019 and 2022 (71% and 72%, respectively). Those who had used cannabis in the past 12 months were more likely to agree (84%) than those who had not (63%).\nIn 2023, the majority (90%) of Canadians believed that cannabis use can be habit-forming, an increase from 82% in 2018 and unchanged from 2022 (89%). This was more common among those who had used cannabis in the past 12 months (92%) than those who had not (89%).\nThe majority of Canadians (87%) reported that it is not okay to use cannabis while pregnant or breastfeeding, a decrease from 2019 (98%) but unchanged from 2022 (86%). This was more common among those who had not used cannabis in the past 12 months (88%) than those who had (83%).\nJust under 7 in 10 (68%) Canadians believed that daily or almost daily cannabis use increases the risk of mental health problems, a decrease from 2019 (89%) but up from 2022 (66%). This was more common among those who had not used cannabis in the past 12 months (70%) than those who had (61%).\n\nPerception that smoking and vaping cannabis regularly carries moderate or great risk has increased since 2018\n\nCompared to 2018, perceived \u00e2\u0080\u0098moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098great\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk increased for smoking cannabis (75%, up from 72%) and vaping* cannabis (78%, up from 70%).\nPerceived moderate or great risk of eating/drinking cannabis decreased compared to 2018 (63%, down from 66%).\nAmong those who had not used cannabis in the past 12 months, a greater percentage perceived \u00e2\u0080\u0098moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098great\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk from regularly smoking (81% vs. 57%), vaping dried cannabis (81% vs. 60%), vaping cannabis extracts (78% vs. 55%), or eating/drinking cannabis (72% vs. 36%) compared to those who had used cannabis (Figure 4).\n\n* In 2023, vaping cannabis combines responses from two questions on vaping dried cannabis (72%) and liquid/solid cannabis extracts (75%).\nExplore the data in Figure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving and cannabis use\n\n\n\nFewer people operated a vehicle after cannabis use in the past 12 monthsFootnote 4\n\nSeventeen percent (17%) of people who had used cannabis in the past 12 months reported driving after cannabis use, a decrease from 27% in 2018.\n                        \nThis included 12% who reported driving within 2 hours of smoking or vapourizing cannabis and 8% who reported driving within 4 hours of ingesting cannabis in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, rates were higher among males than females (19% vs. 14%, respectively) but did not differ by age group.\n\nIn 2023, 86% of Canadians believed that cannabis use impairs one's ability to drive\n\nAmong those who have used cannabis in the past 12 months, 79% felt that cannabis use impairs one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to drive, 13% responded that it depends, and 5% responded that it did not impair one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to drive.\n\nApproximately a quarter (24%) of Canadians believe it is \u00e2\u0080\u0098extremely likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that a driver would be caught driving under the influence of cannabis.\n\nAn additional 37% believe a driver is \u00e2\u0080\u0098somewhat likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to be caught driving under the influence of cannabis, down from 2018 and 2022 (40% and 39%, respectively).\n\n\nThose who used cannabis in the past 12 months were less likely to believe it is \u00e2\u0080\u0098extremely likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that a driver would be caught driving under the influence of cannabis than people who had not used cannabis (20% and 26%, respectively).\n\nExplore the data in Figure 5\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nFootnote 1\n\nTests for statistical significance  were done using regression analyses of the variables across waves of the survey. Follow-up contrasts were conducted to examine year to year comparisons.\nReturn to footnote 1 referrer\n\nFootnote 2\n\nAll reported increases and decreases in the text are statistically significant changes unless it is stated that the percentage is \u00e2\u0080\u009cunchanged\u00e2\u0080\u009d. At times the text may state that the difference is unchanged, even though the numbers are not identical. This occurs when the difference between numbers is not statistically significant. The statistical significance is indicated in the text description tables located under each figure. For additional details about the survey and methodology, refer to 2018 Canadian Cannabis Survey, the 2019 Canadian Cannabis Survey, the 2020 Canadian Cannabis Survey, the 2021 Canadian Cannabis Survey,  2022 Canadian Cannabis Survey, and the 2023 Canadian Cannabis Survey.\nReturn to footnote 2 referrer\n\nFootnote 3\n\nWhen recruited, respondents were informed that the survey was about cannabis. This may have created a participation bias, where people who use cannabis may have been more likely to complete the survey. For this and other methodological reasons, the CCS prevalence estimates for cannabis use may be higher than reported in other Canadian population level surveys.\nReturn to footnote 3 referrer\n\nFootnote 4\n\nThe question regarding driving after cannabis use changed from 2018 to 2019, and remained consistent from 2019 onwards (2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023). In 2018, the question only asked if the person drove within 2 hours of any cannabis use. From 2019-2023 two questions were asked: drove within 2 hours of smoking/vaping cannabis and drove within 4 hours of ingesting cannabis. In order to compare 2018 responses to those in other years, questions were combined to capture driving within 2 hours of smoking/vaping and/or within 4 hours of ingesting cannabis.\nReturn to footnote 4 referrer\n\n\n\nSuggested citation\nCanadian Cannabis Survey.

All positive responses to all childhood maltreatment questions were counted as indicating maltreatment. In contrast, the original analysis rules for the Childhood Experiences of Violence Questionnaire (CEVQ) include all positive responses, except for two of the physical abuse subtypes (the less severe ones) and exposure to intimate partner violence if it occurred less than 3 times.\nAdult is defined as persons 18+ years; Children as persons under 18 years.\nParental characteristics, not child characteristics, were considered as risk or protective factors for child maltreatment. This is based on a public health perspective that parental risk factors may represent potential outcomes of child maltreatment (such as prenatal substance use or violence).\nIn the SYC-Child (Survey of Young Canadians, Child component), the person answering these questions is confirmed at the beginning of the questionnaire to be the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) about the following questions.

The disease is progressive (i.e. it tends to get worse over time) and debilitating. It primarily affects the population age 35 years and older. Long-term exposure to lung irritants is the primary cause of COPD. In Canada and other developed nations, the primary irritant that causes COPD is tobacco smoke.\nIndividuals living with COPD often find that the disease limits their mobility and impacts their ability to engage in activities of daily living.\nAlthough there is currently no cure for COPD, its symptoms can be managed with medications, other therapies and lifestyle changes. Early detection through lung function testing is key to managing COPD and slowing its progression.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) works with the provinces and territories, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS), to collect and report national surveillance data on COPD.\nPHAC recently released the publication,  Report from the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System: Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Canada, 2018, that describes the burden of chronic respiratory diseases in Canada in more detail.\n\n\n\n2 million\nOver 2 million (10%) Canadians aged 35 years and older were living with diagnosed COPD in 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013. [PHAC CCDSS]\n82%\nThe number of Canadians aged 35 years and older living with diagnosed COPD increased by 82% \u00e2\u0094\u0080 from 1.1 million to a little over 2 million \u00e2\u0094\u0080 between 2000\u00e2\u0094\u00802001 and 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013. [PHAC CCDSS]\nThe increase in the number of Canadians living with COPD is being driven by the aging of the population. \nWould you like to see how the proportion of Canadians (35+) living with diagnosed COPD changed over the years? Check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 in 116\nOut of every 116 Canadians aged 35 years and older, 1 was newly diagnosed with COPD in 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013. In 2000\u00e2\u0094\u00802001, this estimate was 1 in 93. [PHAC CCDSS]\nAging and COPD\nThe likelihood of having COPD increases with age.  In 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013, 15% of seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 were living with COPD; for seniors aged 85 years and older, 26% were living with COPD.\nIn younger age groups, women and men are about equally likely to have COPD, while in older age groups, men are more likely to be affected. This may be due to smoking being more common among men than women. [PHAC CCDSS]\nWould you like to explore COPD statistics by age-group and sex? Check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMen vs. Women\nMen are more likely than women to have COPD. However, the gap between men and women with COPD has gradually narrowed over the years.

In 2012\u00e2\u0094\u00802013, the provincial and territorial proportions ranged from 7% to 23%.  [PHAC CCDSS]\nWould you like to see how the provinces and territories compare?

To meet this requirement, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada designed and developed the online reporting tool, the Veterinary Antimicrobial Sales Reporting (VASR) system.\nThe information on this page includes the quantity of sales (measured in kilograms) of medically important antimicrobials by manufacturers and importers, and excludes compounders (unless otherwise noted).\nCIPARS-VASR reports the quantity of antimicrobials sold in four ways: 1) total kilograms, 2) milligrams per Canadian PCU (mg/PCUCA), 3) milligrams per European PCU (mg/PCUEU), and 4) milligrams per biomass at slaughter (mg/biomassSL). The population correction unit (PCU) is a measure of animal biomass that accounts for the number of animals and their average weight at treatment (using either average Canadian or European weights).  The biomass at slaughter is a measure of animal biomass that accounts for the number of production animals and their Canadian average weight at slaughter. Production animals include both horses and food animals (beef and dairy cattle, veal calves, poultry, pigs, sheep, goats, and aquaculture).\nFor additional information, please visit the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) and Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Veterinary Antimicrobial Sales Reporting (VASR).\nThe interactive visualizations are updated regularly, and therefore may differ from published CIPARS reports.\n\nFigure 1.

National COVID-19 activity levels were developed with PT partners to monitor COVID-19 activity at the national and PT levels using a standard set of core indicators. Based on these indicators, COVID-19 activity can range from level 0 (no activity) to level 4 (high activity). They are presented with the overall change (increase, decrease, no change) from the previous week.\nIndicators: The overall COVID-19 activity level is assessed based on the following three indicators, where available:\n\nWeekly percent positivity\n\nWeekly number of lab positive tests / Weekly total number of tests x 100.\nNote: This indicator is only incorporated into overall assessment if the testing rate is greater than or equal to 100 tests per 100,000 population per week. This indicator is used to provide information about overall activity level and trajectory.\n\n\nWeekly long term care facility (LTCF) outbreaks per 1,000,000 population\n\nWeekly number of LTCF outbreaks / Total population in jurisdiction x 1,000,000.\nNote: This indicator is used to provide information on overall activity level and trajectory.\n\n\nWeekly COVID-19 wastewater trajectory\n\nTrajectory of weekly COVID-19 wastewater viral levels compared to the previous week.\nNote: This indicator is used to provide information on overall trajectory only.\n\n\n\nAssessment process: \n\nEach indicator is assigned a level ranging from \u00e2\u0080\u0098no activity detected\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (level 0) to \u00e2\u0080\u0098very high activity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (level 4), based on established thresholds (increasing, decreasing, or no change) of a change of 10% or more compared to the previous week.\nOverall activity level is then determined using the average level of the available indicators (rounding to the nearest whole number).\nOverall trajectory, or the direction of change (based on 10% change compared to the previous week), is calculated based on the mode of the trajectories from available indicators.\n\nData assessment caveats: \n\nThis information is based on data from PT partners. For more up to date information and for public health recommendations or risk assessments, please refer to PT websites.\nWeekly changes in tests performed, and LTCF outbreaks reflect changes in counts between the end of the latest epidemiological week and the end of the previous epidemiological week. Data are updated on an ongoing basis and are subject to change.\nPT testing practices, data sources and reporting to PHAC vary across jurisdictions.\nThere may be variations in the COVID-19 activity across a jurisdiction. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that if there are outbreaks occurring in one area, it may result in a higher level of COVID-19 activity. Weekly activity level assessments are intended to provide a high-level overview of COVID-19 spread using standard indicators at the national and PT level. They may not reflect the true extent of geographic spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 data products\nCOVID-19 surveillance\n\nCOVID-19 wastewater surveillance dashboard\nInteractive data map of COVID-19 cases around the world\nViral respiratory infection data (CNISP)\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination\n\nReported side effects following vaccination\nNumber of people vaccinated in Canada\nNumber of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Canada\nVaccines distributed in Canada\n\nCOVID-19 and mental health\n\nMental Illness during the Pandemic: Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (Cycles 1 and 2)\nMap of Canadian mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic\nInequalities in the mental health of adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nImpacts of COVID-19\n\nFrequency and impact of longer-term symptoms following COVID-19 in Canadian adults\nImpacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Canadian Children with Cognitive, Behavioural or Emotional Disabilities\n\n\nCOVID-19 inequalities\n\nSocial inequalities in COVID-19 deaths in Canada\n\n\n\nProvincial, territorial and international reporting\nFor more information, please refer to provincial or territorial COVID-19 webpages:\n\nBritish Columbia\nAlberta\nSaskatchewan\nManitoba\nOntario\nQuebec\nNewfoundland and Labrador\nNew Brunswick\nNova Scotia\nPrince Edward Island\nYukon\nNorthwest Territories\nNunavut\n\nFor more information, please refer to international COVID-19 webpages:\n\nWorld Health Organization\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nEuropean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\nAdditional COVID-19 data resources\n\n\n\n\nDownload cases and deaths data (.csv) and lab indicators data (.csv)\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload cases and deaths data dictionary (.csv) and lab indicators data dictionary (.csv)\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload report (.pdf)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more, visit COVID-19 data trends\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 wastewater surveillance dashboard\nTrend data about the levels of COVID-19 in the wastewater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination\nNumber of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in Canada.\n\n\n\nAll Health Infobase data products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find what you were looking for?\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nIf not, tell us why:\n\n\nWhat was wrong?\nAnswers to frequently asked questions can be found in the Understanding the data section!\n\n\n\n                                                The answer I need is missing\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                The information isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the right place\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                Something is broken or incorrect\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                Other reason\n                                            \n\n\nPlease provide more details\n\n(Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include any personal information.

Current wastewater signal trends and levels in Canada\n Zoom or tap regions to see current signal trends and levels in Canada. Map data is available in .csv format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Data from {} sites are included on this dashboard.\n                            \n\n\n\n\nIn Canada, 40 sites currently submit sewage samples for processing, representing 49.58% of the Canadian population. Of those sites, 6 showed an increase, 16 showed a decrease, and 18 showed no change as of {{update-date}}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Text description\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nThis information is based on sewage samples submitted for testing to the National Microbiology Laboratory or a participating partner laboratory.\nThe National Microbiology Laboratory conducts testing for over 70 sites across Canada, with partner laboratories conducting testing for other sites. Data from 62 sites are included on this dashboard. Site selection and the decision to publish results on the dashboard is always at the discretion of provinces, territories and municipalities.\nFor the signal level metric, sites are marked as 'new' if they started testing after December 1, 2021. The data for these sites doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cover the entire post-Omicron period, which is the data we normally use to establish cutoff values. Consequently, new sites may underestimate the viral peak of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nInterpreting wastewater data\nThe wastewater dashboard shows the concentration of COVID-19 in wastewater samples from different sites. The solid green line shows the 7-day rolling average of the viral load for each site. We calculate the 7-day rolling average by averaging the viral loads from each sampling event with the previous 6 sampling events. Use the \u00e2\u0080\u0098show daily values\u00e2\u0080\u0099 button to display the daily viral load as a dotted green line. This shows the current trend of the COVID-19 signals and the current signal level compared to previous levels for each site. Use caution when interpreting daily and short-term changes in viral load, as the wastewater signal can change from day to day. An ongoing increase or decrease in the viral load is more reliable for indicating trends.\nIf the wastewater signals are high or increasing, this may indicate a high level of COVID-19 in your community. It's important to pay attention to public health alerts and to follow public health advice. Personal protective measures are effective actions you can take every day to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\nInstructions\n The data throughout the page changes to reflect the date range you select below.

It happens when cells in the brain die or important nerve connections are broken. This process is known as neurodegeneration.\nDementia may be caused by neurodegenerative diseases (affecting brain neurons), vascular diseases (affecting blood vessels, like arteries and veins), and injuries.\nCommon types of dementia include:\n\nAlzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease dementia\nvascular dementia\nmixed dementia\nfrontotemporal dementia\nLewy body dementia\n\nCommon symptoms of dementia include:\n\nmemory loss\njudgement and reasoning problems\nchanges in behaviour, mood and communication abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is affected?Footnote 1\n\nIn 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017, more than 432,000 individuals aged 65 years and older were living with diagnosed dementia in Canada.\nOf these individuals, 2/3 are women.\nAbout 9 Canadians are diagnosed with dementia every hour.\nThe risk of being diagnosed with dementia doubles with every 5-year increase in age, between the ages of 65 and 84.\n\nSee our infographic for a visual summary of key national statistics on dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the health impacts?\nDementia can lead to major health impacts. For example:\n\nOf Canadians living in the community with dementia, 49% reported having fair or poor general health and 58% reported limitations in their mobility (independent physical movement).Footnote 2\nOf Canadians living in long-term care with dementia, 31% had signs of depression.Footnote 3\nOverall, the risk of dying from any cause in 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017 was 4.4 times higher among Canadians aged 65 years and older with diagnosed dementia compared to those without dementia.Footnote 1\n\nMany factors impact someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health. Certain individuals may be more likely to be affected by chronic conditions, like dementia. Some may be at higher risk of developing the condition, while others may face significant barriers to care, which could help reduce dementia health impacts. Read the National Dementia Strategy (Chapter 6) to learn more about dementia and health equity.\nCanada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population is also aging. This means that more Canadians are living longer, and many will develop chronic conditions, including dementia. Working to promote healthy aging and to limit these health impacts will become even more important for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the face of care\nIndividuals with dementia often require care and support from a variety of care providers, including personal support workers, family/friend caregivers and health professionals.\n\nAbout 26 hours per week of informal care is required for Canadians aged 65 and over living with dementia, compared to 17 hours for those without.Footnote 4\nCaregivers are spending $4,600 out-of-pocket annually for each person living with dementia under their care.Footnote 5\n45% of caregivers for individuals with dementia show symptoms of distress, compared to 25% of caregivers for individuals without dementia.Footnote 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) doing?\nSurveillance and data\nTo support the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, PHAC is exploring new ways to expand national data on dementia. Improving dementia surveillance will provide a more accurate picture of the impact of dementia in Canada. \nIn collaboration with all Canadian provinces and territories, PHAC collects, analyzes and shares data on diagnosed dementia, including Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS). To identify people with the condition, a validated case definition is applied to provincial and territorial health insurance registry records linked using a unique personal identifier to the corresponding physician billing claims, hospital discharge abstract records and prescription drug records. This system aids the planning and evaluation of health policies, programs, and services.\nMost recent data from the CCDSS are available on the Public Health Infobase in the CCDSS Data Tool.\nPolicy and program\nPHAC is working with partners at home and abroad to help reduce the risks of developing dementia and improve the quality of life for those affected by dementia. PHAC investments support individuals living with dementia, caregivers and all people living in Canada. This includes funding to:\n\nincrease awareness towards reducing risk and stigma\nimprove access to and use of dementia guidance, such as treatment guidelines and best practices for early diagnosis\nsupport community-based projects that aim to address the challenges of dementia\n\nLooking at dementia through a healthy aging lens, PHAC hopes to reduce the impact of dementia on society and to support the aging population.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about dementia in Canada\n\nRead about Canada's Dementia Strategy (2019)\nVisit Canada.ca and search \"Dementia\"\nGet data in the CCDSS Data Tool\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada, 2020 [Internet].

There are three main types of \r\n              diabetes: type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. If left uncontrolled, diabetes \r\n              results in high blood sugar levels, which can lead to serious complications. \r\n              Fortunately, it is possible to remain healthy with diabetes, so long as it is \r\n              well managed.  \r\n            \n\n\n\nPrevalence\nIncidence\n\r\n                rate of diabetes for \r\n               \nboth\nmales\nfemales\n\r\n               sexes in\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Use the map below to discover diabetes estimates in Canada's provinces and \r\n            territories.

This is why this type of diabetes is called an \"autoimmune\" \r\n                    disease. In order to function, a person whose pancreas isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t producing \r\n                    any insulin or very little must rely on daily medication \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the intake of \r\n                    insulin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to regulate their blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes typically \r\n                    develops in children and youth, but can also occur in adults.\r\n                \n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common form. It happens when the pancreas \r\n                    doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce enough insulin or the body cannot properly use the insulin \r\n                    the pancreas produces. The risk of developing this metabolic disorder is \r\n                    higher in certain ethnic populations and people who are physically inactive, \r\n                    overweight, or obese. Type 2 diabetes usually affects adults over the age \r\n                    of 40, but can be found in children and youth.\r\n                \n\nGestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs only in pregnant\r\n                    women, when high blood sugar levels develop during pregnancy. Although \r\n                    it is temporary and usually disappears weeks after delivery, women who \r\n                    have it are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many Canadians live with diabetes?\n1 in 9\nAbout 11% of Canadian adults aged 20+ live with diagnosed diabetes.\n1 in 333\nAbout 0.3% of Canadian children and youth aged 1-19 live with diagnosed diabetes.\n1 in 10\nThe rate of pregnant women with diagnosed diabetes (both pre-existing and gestational) is 99.1 per 1000 total births.\n549 per day\nOn average, 549 new cases of diabetes are diagnosed each day in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfile of diabetes in Canada\nType 1 vs type 2\nAbout 10% of Canadians with diabetes have type 1 and 90% have type 2. [PHAC 2011]\nMales vs females\nDiabetes is more common among adult men (11.8%) than women (10.0%), while in children and youth, the rates are the same for boys and girls.\nYoung vs old\nWhile only 0.3% of diabetes cases are among Canadians between the ages of 1 to 19, 55% of the cases are among Canadians aged 65+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime trends: going up or down?\nAn increase of 3.3% \u00e2\u0086\u0091\nThe prevalence of Canadians living with diagnosed diabetes went up by an average of 3.3% every year from 2000 to 2016. Numbers are expected to continue rising due to an aging Canadian population and the fact that Canadians are living longer with diabetes.\nEach year, there are approximately 201,000 new cases of diabetes, or 549 new cases per day. Since 2000, age-standardized incidence rates have remained relatively stable.\nAn decrease of 2.1% \u00e2\u0086\u0093\nFrom 2000 to 2016, the mortality rate for those with diabetes decreased by an average of 2.1% per year. The all-cause mortality rate among Canadians with diabetes is twice as high as the all-cause mortality rate for those without diabetes.\n\n\nHover or tab over the bars for more information\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the history of diabetes surveillance in Canada?\nSince 1999, the Government of Canada has reported on rates of diabetes in Canada using the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS). The CCDSS is supported by a pan-Canadian partnership between the Public Health Agency of Canada and all provinces and territories. Since it began, the CCDSS has expanded and now covers a wide range of health diseases and conditions and is able to provide a broad overview of the health of Canadians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about Diabetes in Canada\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Canada.ca and SEARCH \u00e2\u0080\u0098Diabetes\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet data in the data tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us @GovCanHealth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike us @HealthyCdns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2019-11-20\n\n\n\n"

BMI is a measure of a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight in relation to their height squared2.\nAll estimates are taken from the Canadian Risk Factor Atlas (CRFA) using pooled data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, 2015-2018.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 Canadian adults (26.6%) are currently living with obesity.\nObesity rates in Canadian adults are higher in men compared to women (28.0% versus 24.7%, respectively).\n\nGeography and health are closely interconnected. Where we live greatly influences how we live and has a direct effect on our health experiences3.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does \"urban\" and \"rural\" mean?\nStatistics Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Statistical Area Classification divides all Canadian municipalities into two large geographic sets4.\n\nPopulation centres - which we will refer to as \u00e2\u0080\u009curban areas\u00e2\u0080\u009d, consist of areas with a high density concentration of population (i.e. areas with a population of at least 1,000 and a population density of at least 400 persons per km2).\nRural area - All areas outside urban areas.\n\nThe sum of population centres and rural areas cover all Canada.\n\nThe rural area of Canada includes a combination of population living in rural areas embedded in urban areas as well as outside urban areas.\n\n\n\nCredit: Image courtesy of Statistics Canada, rural area detailed definition. Accessed November 4, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the prevalence of obesity in rural and urban Canada compare?\nIn Canada overall, the rate of obesity is higher for adults living in rural areas compared with those living in urban areas, independently of sex.\n\nIn rural areas, about 1 in 3 Canadian adults are living with obesity (31.4%)\nIn urban areas, about 1 in 4 Canadian adults are living with obesity (25.6%)\n\nThis means that there are on average 5.8 more cases of obesity per 100 adults living in rural areas compared with urban areas.\n\n\nFigure 1. Obesity prevalence (%) in Canadian adults by rural-urban place of residence and by sex.\n\nSource: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA.\nPopulation: Adults aged 18+ years, all Canada and by sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographic trends of obesity observed in adults living in rural communities versus cities across Canada\nNot all provinces show higher rates of obesity in rural compared to urban areas.\n\nProvinces with higher rates of adult obesity in rural compared with urban areas were Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec. In these provinces, rural obesity ranged from 3.1 to 7.4 percentage points higher than urban areas (Quebec 27.3% versus 24.2%; Manitoba 36.1% versus 28.7%).\n\nIn Saskatchewan and Manitoba the rural rates of obesity were higher for men only, while in Quebec and Alberta the rates of obesity were higher in rural areas for women only.\n\nThere were no significant differences in obesity rates between adults living in rural versus urban areas in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Obesity prevalence (%) in Canadian adults by provinces and territories and by rural-urban place of residence\n\nSource: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA.\r\n        *Significantly different when comparing rates of obesity among rural versus urban areas of the same province or territory. \nThe prevalence of obesity is higher in small cities compared to large metropolitan cities.\nWhen looking at cities in Canada: \n\nThe lowest rates of adult obesity were observed in the largest urban census metropolitan areas such as Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.\nIn general, obesity rates in adults tend to be higher in smaller cities. The obesity rate in the census agglomerations of Miramichi, Woodstock, Corner Brook, Cape Breton, Yellowknife, Brockville, Dawson Creek, Wood Buffalo and the City of Iqaluit is about 1.5 times the rate of the Canadian average (i.e. greater than 40% versus 26.6%).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Municipalities with the lowest and highest rates of obesity in Canada, adults aged 18 + years.\n\nSource: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA.\r\n        Population: Adults aged 18+ years, selected ^^Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), ^Census Agglomeration (CA) and cities.\r\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, the urban-rural disparities in adult obesity are complex and multifactorial!\nIn the past, urbanization was considered one of the most important drivers of the rise in obesity in industrialized countries. Recent global and national studies show that urbanization of rural life has contributed to a larger increase in rural obesity5,6.\nThis change in the geographic distribution of obesity can be partly explained by the growing economic and social disadvantage that rural communities compared to urban cities experience. In particular, rural communities experience lower education and income, lower availability of healthy and fresh foods at a reasonable cost, less access to public transportation and lack of supportive environments to promote walkability, sports and recreational activities5.\nSocioeconomic characteristics at the municipality level must be kept in mind to understand urban-rural disparities in obesity rates for adults when interpreting this data.\n\nIn Canada overall, adult obesity is more prevalent among disadvantaged population groups such as those unemployed or with lower household income and education levels.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Obesity prevalence in Canadian adults by socio-economic status.\n\nSource: Canadian Community Health Survey pooled data, 2015-2018, as reported in the CRFA.\r\n        Population: Adults aged 18+ years, all Canada.\r\n        \n\nKey messages\nRecent global trends show that the prevalence of obesity is rising faster among people living in rural than those living in urban areas.\n\nPopulation based data from 2015 to 2018 shows that, in Canada overall, the rate of obesity is higher in rural versus urban areas (31.4% vs. 25.6%).\nWhen looking at cities in Canada:\n\nThe lowest rates of adult obesity were observed in the largest urban census metropolitan areas.\nIn general, obesity rates in adults tend to be higher in smaller cities.\nAlthough adult obesity rates in the territories are among the highest in Canada, there were no urban-rural disparities.\n\nIn Canada overall, adult obesity is more prevalent among disadvantaged population groups such as those unemployed or with lower household income and education levels.\n\nData on how obesity rates in rural and urban populations is changing may assist policy-makers and local communities to target policies, programs and services aiming to promoting healthy weights at an appropriate geographic level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nFor more information, visit the Canadian Risk Factor Atlas (CRFA).\nThe CRFA permits data exploration by geography beyond rural versus population centre place of residence. Should you need further geographic data granularity, the CRFA is a new dynamic interface that integrates surveillance of key chronic disease and mental health risk factors (e.g. obesity, overweight, physical inactivity, fair or poor perceived health, lack of community support and sense of belonging, etc.) into a geospatial platform at multiple levels of geography from national to large municipalities and cities including the territorial capitals. Data can also be retrieved by other demographic and key socioeconomic determinants of health.\n\n\nReferences\n\nWorld Health Organization. Obesity and overweight Fact sheet No 311.

Diagnoses are most often made during pregnancy and the first year of the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Children with Down syndrome present with well-defined physical characteristics. They often experience intellectual delay and are at an increased risk for several medical conditions. Congenital heart defects and respiratory infections are the most frequently reported causes of death in children and young adults with Down syndrome. Childhood leukemia is commonly associated with Down syndrome. However, the life-expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome has improved over time.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada's  Canadian Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System  (CCASS) monitors and reports on national estimates and trends of congenital anomalies including Down syndrome. The CCASS is part of the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System (CPSS). The CPSS is a national health surveillance program aiming to contribute to the improved health of pregnant women, mothers and infants in Canada.\n\n\n\n21\nDown syndrome occurs due to the presence of an extra chromosome 21.

While offering individuals numerous health benefits, activities that take place in bodies of water (even bathing!) require many safety considerations. Presented below are statistics highlighting non-fatal and fatal drowning events, using the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database, the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) and the Canadian Vital Statistics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Death Database (CVSD).\nWhat is drowning?\nDrowning is defined as a process of experiencing breathing difficulties resulting from being in or under a liquid, such as waterFootnote 1. Such an injury can cause serious, long-term health outcomes to individuals and be fatal. \n\n\n\n\nEmergency Departments (CHIRPP database)\nHow many cases were there?\nBetween April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023, there were 1,109 drowning-related cases reported in CHIRPP, representing 58.6 cases/100,000 CHIRPP records. Of the 1,109 drowning-related cases, males accounted for more than half (58.9%) of the emergency department (ED) visits. Infants and children aged 9 years or younger represented the largest percentage at 79.2% (n = 878)Footnote *. A total of 35 drowning fatalities have been reported in CHIRPP since 2011. Of those, children aged between 2 and 9 years accounted for 60.0% of cases (n = 21).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do drownings happen?\nDrownings happen year-round. The majority of cases (73.0%; n = 810) occurred during warmer months (May, June, July, August and September), among which 507 cases involved swimming pools (62.5%) and 176 cases, natural bodies of water. There were 200 cases (18.0%) reported during the colder months (January, February March, November and December). Half of these cases (n =100) occurred in bathtubs and 80 in swimming pools (40.0%). \nWhere do drownings happen?\nSwimming Pool\nOf all 1,109 drowning cases, the majority (56.3%; n = 624) occurred in residential or public swimming pools, among which, 79.6% were infants and children aged 9 years or younger (n = 497). \nBathtubs\nThere were 237 reported drownings (21.4%) that occurred in bathtubs, 73.0% of which involved infants aged 1 year or younger (n = 173).\nNatural Bodies of Water\nNearly one-fifth (18.8%; n = 209) of all drownings occurred in natural bodies of water, including ponds, lakes and rivers. The majority of these cases (62.2%) involved infants and children aged 9 years or younger (n = 130).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat level of in-hospital treatment was needed?\nOverall, 42.4% of patients required observation or received medical treatment in the ED (n =470), while 28.5% of patients were admitted to the hospital for treatment (n = 316).\nHospitalizations (Discharge Abstract Database)\nBetween fiscal years 2009/10 and 2021/22 there were 2,283 drowning-related hospitalizationsFootnote ** in Canada, excluding Quebec hospitals, an average of 175 per year. Of these cases, 64.4% were males (n = 1,470). \nPresented in Table 1 is a breakdown of the types of body of water where the drownings occurred. Drownings involving swimming pools had the highest percentage at 34.9%. Among these cases, 65.5% involved children under the age of 15 years (n =521). Drownings involving natural bodies of water represented 29.2% of hospitalizations, among which 72.1% were aged 20 years or older.\n\n\n\n                    Table 1: Number and proportion of drowning-related hospitalizations by type of body of water - Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) (2009/10 - 2021/22)\n                \n\n\n\n\nBody of water\nCount\nProportion (%)\n\n\n\n\nSwimming pool\n796\n34.9\n\n\nNatural bodies of water\n666\n29.2\n\n\nBath\n229\n10.0\n\n\nUnspecified\n592\n25.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaths (Canadian Vital Death Statistics)\nDrowning is one of the leading causes of injury death among childrenFootnote 2.\nHow many deaths were due to drownings?\nIn 2020, 323 people died due to unintentional drowningsFootnote ** in Canada, among which nearly half (47%; n =152) occurred in natural bodies water. Between 2015 and 2020, there have been 1,768 reported deaths, an average 294 per year. \nSwimming Pools\nOf the 323 deaths, 39 people (12.1%) died from drowning in swimming pools. Of these cases, 43.6% were children between the ages of 1 and 9 years (n = 17).\n\n\n\nTake Note\nThe results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all drowning cases in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, M\u00c3\u00a9tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. As noted above, hospitalization and death counts are based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) codes W65-W74.\nLearn more about: Swimming safety, Recreational water activities, Water toys, Choosing lifejackets or Personal flotation devices, and Drowning prevention.\n\nReferences and Footnotes\n\nFootnote 1\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

Family violence is any form of abuse or neglect that a child or adult experiences from a family member, or from someone with whom they have an intimate relationship. It is an abuse of power by a person to hurt and control someone who trusts and depends on them.

With their impressive auditory and visual effects, it is not surprising that such products play important roles in celebrating special events. From the Inuvik Sunrise Festival in the Northwest Territories to the Canada Day celebrations occurring in many regions across Canada, such displays attract and amaze large crowds. However, when proper safety precautions are not taken, injuries can occur placing the health of individuals at risk.\nPresented below are statistics highlighting injuries associated with fireworks and other related products, such as sparklers and firecrackers, reported between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023 in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database.\nFor information on fireworks safety, please see this fireworks safety video.\n\n\n\nHow many cases were there?\nBetween April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023, there were 210 reported cases of injuries related to fireworks and other similar products, representing 11 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records.\nAge groups\nYoung adults between the ages of 20 and 29 years represented the largest proportion at 22 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records but were closely followed by those aged of 30 and 39 years, who represented 18 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records.\nMales vs. females\nOverall, 67.1% of the patients injured were male (n = 141).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDays of the week injury occurred\nOver half of all injuries (57.1%) occurred on a Saturday, Sunday or Monday.\nTime of year during which injury occurred \nApproximately two-thirds of all injuries (66.2%) occurred between May and August. Nearly a third of all injuries (29.0%; n = 61) occurred on days surrounding Victoria Day (May 16 to 24) and Canada Day (June 29 to July 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost common injuries\nThe most common type of injuries were burns, representing 61.0% of cases (n = 128), followed by eye injuries at 19.1% (n = 40). Of the 128 burns, the most affected body region was the upper extremity region (hands, fingers and forearms), which represented 55.5% of such cases (n = 71). The head and neck region then followed, representing 25.0% of burns (n = 32). Thirty-eight individuals (18.1%) sustained burns in multiple body regions. \nWhat level of in-hospital treatment was needed?\nNearly three-quarters of all cases (73.8%) required medical treatments in the emergency departments, and 11.4% of patients were admitted to hospitals.\n\n\n\nTake note\nCHIRPP is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 10 general hospitals across Canada. Since its inception in 1990, this database has colected over 4.2 million records, making it an important resource for information on injuries and moving forward programs and policies that aim at reducing and preventing injuries among Canadians. Learn more about the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program.\nData extraction was conducted using English and French key word searches in the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 narratives of the injury event and examining factor codes pertaining to injuries concerning fireworks and other related products.\nThe results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all injuries related to fireworks and other similar products in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, M\u00c3\u00a9tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. \nMore information and related material about fireworks use is available.\n\n\n\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInjuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation\nAnalysis of such injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrowning related deaths and injuries\nStatistics highlighting drownings.\n\n\n\nAll Health Infobase data products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find what you were looking for?\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nIf not, tell us why:\n\n\nWhat was wrong?\nAnswers to frequently asked questions can be found in the Understanding the data section!\n\n\n\n                                                    The answer I need is missing\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    The information isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the right place\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    Something is broken or incorrect\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    Other reason\n                                                \n\n\nPlease provide more details\n\n(Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include any personal information.

In some sports, head injuries are common and their potential short-and long-term consequences can be severe.\nWhile all hits to the head can be problematic, repetitive head impact can cause long-term brain damage, and in some cases, even death. Children and youth are particularly at risk of long-term effects following head injuries and concussions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about playing smart, limiting the risk of head injuries while being active.\r\n\r\nMany sports-related head injuries, including concussions, are preventable and with early and proper detection and care, risks can be minimized.

Users must note that estimates for 2009\u20132011 and 2016\u20132020 reference periods were coded to different suppression rules:for data from 2009 - 2011:  If the numerator for a subpopulation category is less than 5, the result for this category is suppressed.For data from 2016\u20132020:  a) if a subpopulation category has fewer than 10 observations in the numerator or less than 20 in the denominator, all estimates are suppressed; b) if coefficient of variance (CV) >33.3 for crude rate or age-standardized rate, the estimate is also suppressed.Data are age-standardized to the 2016 Canadian population, using five-year age groups\n\nSource: Vital Statistics - Death Database (2016-2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Citation: \r\n                Pan-Canadian Health Inequalities Data Tool.

An obese child will likely become an obese adult. Obesity in adulthood has been linked to many conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer and poor emotional health.\nChildhood obesity levels remain high\nOver the last 35 years, obesity rates among Canadian children and youth aged 6-17 years have more than doubled, from 6% in 1978/79 to 13% in 2013/14. Over the past 10 years, although there have been efforts to reduce childhood obesity, there has been no significant decline in childhood obesity and rates have remained stable but high. [CMAJ] [Statistics Canada]\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada reports regularly on a variety of factors associated with obesity and provides helpful tips to achieve the healthiest lifestyle possible.\n\n\n\n\nA healthy lifestyle in childhood can have long lasting benefits\nHealthy eating, physical activity, limited sedentary time and adequate sleep, are important to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.\nEat well\n43.6% of youth 12-19 years old report eating fruits or vegetables five or more times a day. \nEating fruits and vegetables on a daily basis is a good marker of a healthy diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrink water\n13.4% of children 5-11 years old and 21.3% of youth 12-17 years old said they drink 1 or more sugar-sweetened beverages every day. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, like fruit-flavoured juice, soft drinks, and sports/energy drinks, has risen dramatically in recent years and can increase the risk of obesity.  [Healthy Canadians]\nMake water your beverage of choice! Choose it instead of beverages that are high in calories or sugar.\nBe active!\n13.6% of children 5-11 years old are achieving the recommended 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-physical activity daily. That number drops to only 5% for older children (12-17 years old). [CSEP Guidelines]\nExercise boosts agility, coordination, brain power and intellect! Making it a habit at an early age will provide your child with lifelong health benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit screen time\n75.9% of children 5-11 years old are limiting their screen time to no more than 2 hours per day, as recommended. In contrast, only 25.1% of older children (12-17 years old) are meeting this recommendation.  [CSEP Guidelines]\nRegardless of how much physical activity they are getting, children should have limited screen-based activities.\nGet your zzzz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n81.8% of children ages 5-11 and 67.0% of youth aged 12-17 are getting adequate daily sleep.  [CSEP Guidlines]\nGetting the right amount and quality of sleep can help reduce the risk of childhood obesity.\n\n\n\nDive Into the Data\nChildhood Obesity Rates by Age Group\nThe table below shows the persistently high levels of obesity among Canadian children and youth in the last decade.\n\nChildhood Obesity Rates by Age Group (%)\n\n\nYears\nAges 6 to 11\nAges 12 to 17\n\n\nChildhood Obesity Rateand 95% Confidence Interval (%)\nChildhood Obesity Rateand 95% Confidence Interval (%)\n\n\n\n\n2004\n13.9 +/- 2.1\n12.3 +/- 1.7\n\n\n2007 - 2009\n14.6 +/- 3.0\n15.3 +/- 5.2\n\n\n2009 - 2011\n13.3 +/- 3.4\n10.2 +/- 3.4\n\n\n2012 - 2013\n9.6 +/- 2.6\n16.6 +/- 5.5\n\n\n\nChildhood Obesity Rates by Sex\nThe table below details that obesity levels have remained persistently high for both Canadian boys and girls.\n\nChildhood Obesity Rates by Sex (%)\n\n\nYears\nBoys\nGirls\n\n\nChildhood Obesity Rateand 95% Confidence Interval (%)\nChildhood Obesity Rateand 95% Confidence Interval (%)\n\n\n\n\n2004\n15.5 +/- 2.1\n10.6 +/- 1.7\n\n\n2007 - 2009\n17.9 +/- 3.5\n11.9 +/- 3.4\n\n\n2009 - 2011\n14.7 +/- 2.6\n8.2 +/- 2.5\n\n\n2012 - 2013\n15.3 +/- 4.8\n10.8 +/- 2.3\n\n\n\nA confidence interval (as indicated above), is a range within which we can say, with a degree of accuracy (or confidence), that an estimate falls within.

Conclusions should therefore only be drawn after one has compared estimates and their confidence intervals.\n\n\nFor more information and related material please visit:\n[Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth]\n[Chronic Disease and Injury Indicator Framework]\n[Sedentary Behaviour in Children and Youth: A New Health Risk]\n[Towards a Healthier Canada \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2015 Progress Report on Advancing the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Framework on Health Weights]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2016-09-16\n\n\n\n"

In Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death and accounted for over 51,500 deaths in 2015.Footnote\u00a01\nHeart disease is a condition in which the heart muscle is damaged or does not function properly. Plaque (composed of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances) builds up on the inner walls of coronary arteries and, over time, it can harden or rupture. As a result, the inside of the coronary arteries narrow and the flow of blood to the heart muscle is reduced. A blood clot can also form in a coronary artery when plaque ruptures. In such a case, the flow of blood to the heart muscle is blocked.\nCommonly known heart diseases include: ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [also known as a heart attack], angina, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and heart failure.  Heart disease symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue and sweating, among others.\nThe Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) is a collaborative network of provincial and territorial chronic disease surveillance systems led by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Using data from the CCDSS, estimates are provided from 2000\u00e2\u0080\u00932001 to 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 for the number of Canadians living with heart disease and those who are newly diagnosed. Trends in mortality are also explored.\nPHAC recently released the publication, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Report from the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System: Heart Disease in Canada, 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0099  that describes epidemiological trends and profiles of IHD, AMI (which is a subset of IHD) as well as heart failure.\n\n\n\nWho is affected?\nIn 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013, about 2.4 million (or 1 in 12) Canadians aged 20 years and older were living with IHD, the most common type of heart disease. Of those, about 578,000 (2.1%) individuals had a history of AMI. Another 669,600 (3.6%) Canadians adults aged 40 years and older had heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMen vs. Women\nIn any given year observed, more men than women live with or are newly diagnosed with IHD, AMI or heart failure. The only exception is for those aged 85 years and over. Although the rates for these diseases are still higher in men than in women at that age, the difference in rates between the sexes diminishes.\nSimilarly, among individuals with IHD or heart failure, rates of death (due to any cause) were higher in men than in women. However, among those with a history of AMI, women aged 45 to 74 years old were about 1.3 times more likely to die of any cause in a given year compared to men of the same age.  \nOne of the factors that may explain poorer outcomes in women with a history of AMI compare to men is the fact that women sometimes have more subtle symptoms which may contribute to delays in seeking medical care. In addition, women tend to have more complications (e.g. major bleeding) than men during hospitalizations.\nTo find out the estimates by age group and sex, check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung vs. Old\nMore Canadians are affected by heart disease as they get older. About two thirds of Canadians who live with IHD and over 80% of those who have heart failure are 65 years or older.\nHeart disease can develop at a younger age too. As many as 38,000 Canadians aged 20 to 39 years old were living with IHD and over 35,000 Canadians aged 40 to 54 years old were living with heart failure in 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013.\nTo find out the estimates by age group and sex, check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing or decreasing?\nThe proportion of Canadians living with IHD and heart failure remained relatively stable over the 13-year period from 2000\u00e2\u0080\u00932001 to 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 while all-cause mortality rates declined respectively by 24% and 26%.\nThe proportion of those with a history of AMI increased by 67% over the same period while all-cause mortality rates declined by close to 35%. These trends are a likely indication of better survival, mostly due to the reduction of certain risk factor and improvements in disease management and treatments.\nTo see trends over the years, check out the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dive into the Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section below. \n\n\n\nDive into the Data\nHeart disease prevalence (%) by age group and sex, Canada, 2012-2013\n\n\n\nSelect Disease Type:\nIschemic Heart Disease (Age 20+)\nAcute Myocardial Infarction (Age 20+)\nHeart Failure (Age 40+)\n\n\n\nTable 1: Heart disease prevalence (%) by age group and sex, Canada, 2012-2013\n\n\n\nAge Group\nFemale\nMale\nTotal\n\nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \n\n\n\n\n20-39\n0.360.360.370.420.420.430.390.390.4\n\n\n40-54\n2.282.262.294.154.134.173.223.23.23\n\n\n55-64\n7.327.287.3513.6313.5813.6710.4410.4210.47\n\n\n65-74\n16.0615.9916.1226.8126.7326.921.2721.2221.33\n\n\n75-84\n28.3228.2128.4240.8940.7541.0433.9533.8634.04\n\n\n85+\n38.4938.3338.6547.8747.6248.1241.7141.5741.85\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Group\nFemale\nMale\nTotal\n\nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \n\n\n\n\n20-39\n0.020.020.020.070.060.070.040.040.04\n\n\n40-54\n0.330.320.331.261.251.270.790.790.8\n\n\n55-64\n1.171.161.194.324.294.352.732.722.75\n\n\n65-74\n2.652.622.677.627.587.675.065.045.09\n\n\n75-84\n5.355.315.410.9610.8911.037.867.827.9\n\n\n85+\n9.058.979.1313.7413.6113.8810.6610.5910.73\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Group\nFemale\nMale\nTotal\n\nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \nPrevalence (%)\n95% CI (lower limit) \n95% CI (upper limit) \n\n\n\n\n40-54\n0.340.330.340.530.530.540.440.430.44\n\n\n55-64\n1.351.341.372.322.302.341.831.821.84\n\n\n65-74\n3.813.783.846.035.996.064.884.864.91\n\n\n75-84\n10.3310.2610.3913.5513.4713.6311.7711.7211.82\n\n\n85+\n22.3222.1922.4424.3724.1924.5523.0222.9223.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData source: Public Health Agency of Canada, using Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System data files contributed by provinces and territories, May 2016.

Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from natural sources (such as the sun) and artificial sources (including industrial equipment and indoor tanning devices) also poses health risksFootnote 2. As our climate continues to change, these types of events are expected to become more severeFootnote 3Footnote 4. With respect to health impacts, hotter extreme temperatures have been linked to an increase in the number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions, as extreme heat can exacerbate certain cardiovascular and respiratory diseasesFootnote 5Footnote 6Footnote 7Footnote 8. While extreme heat can put everyone at risk from heat illnesses, some population groups that are more susceptible to extreme heat include infants and young children, older adults, people with chronic and/or pre-existing illnesses (e.g. pre-existing heart, pulmonary, renal and psychiatric conditions) and people who are experiencing homelessnessFootnote 3Footnote 5Footnote 7Footnote 9.\nThis data blog presents statistics on sun- and heat-related cases reported to the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) between April 1, 2011 and January 12, 2023. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects injury and poisoning data from the EDs of 11 pediatric and 10 general hospitals located across CanadaFootnote 10.\n\n\n\nTypes of sun- and heat-related injuries and illnesses\nHeat-related illnesses are usually caused by exposure to unusual or lengthened amounts of heat and humidity without adequate fluid intake or relief. They can come on quickly and have serious consequences such as long-term health problems or even death. Overexposure to UV radiation can cause sunburns, skin aging, eye cataracts and skin cancer. Some of the most common types of heat-related illnesses and injuries areFootnote 3Footnote 11Footnote 12Footnote 13Footnote 14:\n\nHeat stroke: This heat-related illness is the most severe. It is caused by a rapid increase in body temperature and problems regulating the sweating mechanisms.\nHeat exhaustion:  A disproportionate loss of water and salt caused by exposure to heat (usually due to heavy sweating). People affected may experience a fast and weak pulse rate, dizziness, nausea and muscle cramps.\nHeat syncope: A fainting episode that is caused by low blood pressure when heat causes the dilation of blood vessels.\nHeat cramps: Painful muscle spasms caused by a salt imbalance due to sweating.\nHeat rashes: Skin irritation usually caused by an inflammation of clogged sweat glands accompanied by red spots. \nSunburns: This injury is characterized by red, painful and unusually warm skin after overexposure to UV radiation. More severe cases can be accompanied by swelling of the skin, blisters and fever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Departments (CHIRPP database)\n\nBetween April 1, 2011, and January 12, 2023, there were 734 sun and heat-related casesFootnote + reported in CHIRPP, representing 39.7 cases per 100 000 CHIRPP records. Males accounted for 57.1% of cases (n = 419). Individuals aged 19 years and younger represented 71.8% of sun- and heat-related cases (n = 527) (Table 1).\n\n\n\n                    Table 1: Demographic characteristics of sun- and heat-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n                \n\n\n         Table 1:  Demographic characteristics of sun- and heat-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n         \n\n\nCharacteristics\nCount (%)\nProportion (per 100,000 CHIRPP records) *\n\n\n\n\nSex\nFemale\n315 (42.9)\n38.6\n\n\nMale\n419 (57.1)\n40.9\n\n\nAge group (years)\n0 to 1\n55 (7.5)\n29.6\n\n\n2 to 4\n40 (5.4)\n14.6\n\n\n5 to 9\n116 (15.8)\n35.4\n\n\n10 to 14\n179 (24.4)\n44.7\n\n\n15 to 19\n137 (18.7)\n59.8\n\n\n20 to 29\n72 (9.8)\n70.3\n\n\n30 to 64\n86 (11.7)\n38.2\n\n\n65+\n49 (6.7)\n48.0\n\n\n\n\n\n* Expressed as a normalized frequency relative to CHIRPP database denominators (not Canadian population denominators).

The most frequent body parts affected by sunburn injuries were the shoulders (27.0%), followed by the face (25.1%) and the back (13.5%). Over a quarter of all cases (27.5%; n = 202) were diagnosed with a form of heat-related stress or systemic overexertion, ranking this health outcome as the second most common type of injury (Table 2). Nine percent of cases (9.0%; n = 66) were diagnosed with other injuries (e.g., open wound, concussion, dislocation).\n\n\n\n                    Table 2: Type of Injury among sun- and heat-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n                \n\n\n         Table 2: Type of injury among sun- and heat-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n         \n\n\nType of Injury\nCount\nPercent (%)\n\n\n\n\nSunburn\n407\n55.4\n\n\nHeat stress/systemic overexertion\n202\n27.5\n\n\nSunburn and heat stress/systemic overexertion\n8\n1.1\n\n\nOther injuries**\n66\n9.0\n\n\nNo injury detected/nature of injury not specified\n51\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n\n** Other injuries include superficial, soft tissue, open wound, concussion, minor head injury, fracture, dislocation, sprain/strain, injury to muscle/tendon, dental injury, poisoning, asphyxia. Among these cases, although no formal heat stress/overexertion or sunburn diagnosis was given, the injury event description contained information regarding heat or sun exposure or suspected heat illness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do sun- and heat-related illnesses and injuries happen?\nSun- and heat-related illnesses and injuries generally occur during the warmer months. More specifically, 90.3% of sun- and heat-related cases took place during the months of May to August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat were people doing?\nWhere reported, Table 3 shows the event circumstances associated with the two most common types of injuries noted above, namely sunburns and heat stress/systemic overexertion. With respect to sunburns, the most common circumstances were sport participation (33.1%; n = 84), followed by playing outdoors (23.2%; n = 59) and sitting, lying, sleeping and suntanning (13.8%; n = 35)(Table 3). Similar to sunburn injuries, the most common circumstances associated with heat stress/systemic overexertion cases were sport participation (33.1%; n = 56), followed by playing outdoors (14.8%; n = 25) and working (14.8%; n = 25).\nA closer look at the circumstances:\n\nSunburns\n\nSports and recreational activities: Among the sunburn cases, the four most frequent sports and activities were swimming (53.6%), non-motorized boating (9.5%), water slides (4.8%), and fishing (4.8%).\nLeisure activities: This category contained an array of activities like woodworking, watching a sports game and going to an outdoor music festival.\n\n\nHeat stress/systemic overexertion\n\nSports and recreational activities: Among the heat stress/overexertion cases, the three most frequent sports and activities were swimming (17.9%), water slides (14.3%) and soccer (10.7%). \nWorking: Various occupations were reported, including firefighting, landscaping, construction work, paramedic work, and lifeguarding.\nIn car or vehicle: All 13 cases in this category occurred among children 4 years of age or younger, who were inadvertently left in or locked in a car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Table 3: Event circumstances* among the two common types of sun- and heat-related injuries in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n                \n\n\n         Table 3: Event circumstances* among the two common types of sun- and heat-related injuries in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n         \n\n\nCircumstances\nCount\nPercent (%)\n\n\n\n\nSunburn\nSports and recreational activities\n84\n33.1\n\nPlaying outside\n59\n23.2\n\n\nSitting/lying/sleeping/sun tanning\n35\n13.8\n\n\nVacation\n25\n9.8\n\n\nLeisure time\n21\n8.3\n\n\nWorking\n8\n3.1\n\n\nWalking\n6\n2.4\n\n\nIn car or vehicle\n2\n0.8\n\n\nSummer camp activities\n1\n0.4\n\n\nOther\n13\n5.1\n\n\nHeat stress/systemic overexertion\nSports and recreational activities\n56\n33.1\n\n\nPlaying outside\n25\n14.8\n\n\nWorking\n25\n14.8\n\n\nIn car or vehicle\n13\n7.7\n\n\nLeisure activity\n13\n7.7\n\n\nWalking\n11\n6.5\n\n\nSitting/lying/sleeping/sun tanning\n8\n4.7\n\n\nStanding\n6\n3.6\n\n\nSummer camp activities\n5\n3.0\n\n\nVacation\n2\n1.2\n\n\nOther\n5\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n* Excludes 186 cases with missing or insufficient information about the event circumstance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do heat-related illnesses and sunburns happen?\nWhere reported, Table 4 presents the locations concerning the two most common types of sun- and heat-related injuries (sunburns and heat stress/systemic overexertion). Among sunburn injuries, the most frequently reported locations were natural bodies of water, such as a beach, lake, or river (35.8%; n =78), residential settings (23.9%; n = 52), and public parks (12.4%; n = 27). With respect to heat stress/systemic overexertion cases, the most frequently reported locations were public spaces, including sidewalks, streets and parking lots (17.3%; n =23), aquatic recreation facilities (12.8%; n = 17), and residential settings (12.8%; n = 17).\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Table 4: Location* among the two common types of sun- and heat-related injuries in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n                \n\n\n         Table 4: Location* among the two common types of sun- and heat-related injuries in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011 to January 12, 2023.\n         \n\n\nLocation\nCount\nPercent (%)\n\n\n\n\nSunburn\nNatural bodies of water (e.g., beach, lake, river)\n78\n35.8\n\n\nResidential setting (e.g., own home, other home)\n52\n23.9\n\n\nPublic park\n27\n12.4\n\n\nAquatic recreation facility (e.g., water park, community swimming pool, splash pad)\n23\n10.6\n\n\nCamping ground, cottage\n10\n4.6\n\n\nHotel, resort, B&B\n5\n2.3\n\n\nOther sport/recreation facility\n5\n2.3\n\n\nOther specified location\n18\n8.3\n\n\nHeat stress/systemic overexertion\nStreets, highways, parking lots, sidewalks, bicycle paths, transit stations\n23\n17.3\n\n\nAquatic recreation facility (e.g., water park, community swimming pool, splash pad)\n17\n12.8\n\n\nResidential setting (e.g., own home, other home)\n17\n12.8\n\n\nNatural bodies of water (e.g., beach, lake, river)\n15\n11.3\n\n\nPublic park\n13\n9.8\n\n\nAmusement park, zoo, fair\n9\n6.8\n\n\nSchool/daycare\n9\n6.8\n\n\nOther sport/recreation facility\n8\n6.0\n\n\nOther specific location\n22\n16.5\n\n\n\n\n\n* Excludes 258 cases with missing or insufficient information about the location. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat level of in-hospital treatment was needed?\nTable 5 shows the level of in-hospital treatment for all reported sun- and heat-related cases. Out of the 734 sun- and heat-related cases, 60.0% required medical treatment in the ED. Additionally, 20 patients (2.7%) were admitted to the hospital, of which, just over half (55.0%) were among males, a quarter (25.0%) were among adults aged 65 years or older and 20.0% were among infants younger than 2 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Table 5: Level of in-hospital treatment among sun- and heat-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011, to January 12, 2023.\n                \n\n\n         Table 5: Level of in-hospital treatment among sun- and heat-related cases in CHIRPP, April 1, 2011, to January 12, 2023.\n         \n\n\nTreatment\nCount\nPercent (%)\n\n\n\n\nReceived treatment\n440\n60.0\n\n\nAdvice only\n182\n24.8\n\n\nObserved in ED\n62\n8.4\n\n\nLeft without being seen\n30\n4.1\n\n\nAdmitted to hospital\n20\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample narratives\nSample narratives of the sun- and heat-related cases entered in CHIRPP charts are listed below. These include:\n\nSunburn\n\nTouch football. Put on sunscreen in the morning but was outside all day. Sunburn to face and arms. \nPlaying outside for long period \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no sunscreen or hat \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has sunburn to face.\nHomeless, outside without shirt for most of last 2 days, sunburned shoulders. \nFell asleep in the sun. \nGot sunburnt while on vacation. Sunscreen was being used.\nWatching baseball game, got sunburn on leg.\n\n\nHeat stress/systemic overexertion\n\nPlaying at water-park - outside for 5 hours - 23 degrees weather. \nFriend found patient sitting in apartment, apartment too hot.\nAttending soccer camp, 29 degree Celsius temperature, running a lot, complains of heat exhaustion.\nLandscaping for 48 hours. Did not hydrate well while outside.\nPatient was accidentally locked in family car, in car seat for about 15 mins with all windows closed in the sunlight (overheated). \nWhile at summer school, felt nausea and dizziness. Air conditioning in school not working.\nPatient was roofing for couple of hours in the sun and developed headache, nausea and dizziness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention\nIt is important to keep in mind that too much sun or heat can be harmful. Here are a few general, sun- and heat-related safety tips:\n\nIt is important to protect yourself from UV rays all year round \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even during the winter, on cloudy days or when you are in the water. \nApply sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, wear loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing and a wide brimmed hat made of breathable fabrics, and use sunglasses that protect from both UVA and UVB rays. \nNever leave people or pets alone in a parked vehicle, even if a window is cracked.\nReduce the time you spend in the sun and heat. If you can, reschedule outdoor activity to a cooler part of the day or another day.\nDrink plenty of liquids before you feel thirsty to stay hydrated and avoid heat-related illnesses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 water is best.\nSpend a few hours in a cool place. It could be a tree-shaded area, swimming facility or an air-conditioned spot.\nSome medications and illnesses (e.g., cardiac, respiratory and psychiatric conditions) may make you more vulnerable to extreme heat. Ask your healthcare provider if you are at risk.\n\nFor more information on extreme heat and sun safety tips, you can visit the following websites:\n\nSun safety basics -Canada.ca\nSun safety tips for parents - Canada.ca\nExtreme heat events: how to protect yourself - Canada.ca\n It's much too hot!

Thus, the illness and injury estimates from CHIRPP are not representative of the national population. Some reported sunburn injuries may have resulted from industrial sources. Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Climate Change and Innovation Bureau is currently working towards publishing a national-level descriptive epidemiological report on heat injuries/illnesses and deaths in Canada.\nAdults older than 18 years of age, Indigenous peoples including First Nations, Inuit and M\u00c3\u00a9tis, and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are pediatric hospitals located in major citiesFootnote 10. Thus, while older adults are at greater risk for extreme heat, this group may not be well captured through CHIRPP data. Additionally, fatal injuries are under-represented in the CHIRPP database because the emergency department data does not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another departmentFootnote 10. Information is continuously being entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data.\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nGovernment of Canada.

The anonymous survey included community-based organizations, public health units and other service providers who directly deliver STBBI-related services, including harm reduction and drug treatment services in Canada.

We also studied risk factors that are modifiable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or within our control to change - like smoking, eating unhealthy foods, not getting enough physical activity, being sedentary for long stretches of time and using alcohol excessively.\nRisk factors increase your chances of developing a disease.Risk factors are either modifiable, meaning you can change them (like a behaviour), or non-modifiable, which means they cannot be changed (like a person's genetics and age).\n\nAfter much number crunching, the data tell us that Canadians are generally healthy. We are living longer than our grandparents and great-grandparents and our overall health is similar to that of other developed countries. That said, many Canadians experience poor health. Chronic diseases cause 65% of the deaths in Canada each year. Although most often diagnosed in older age groups, chronic diseases could affect everyone.\n\n\nHere is what we found...\n\n\n\nThe good news\nCanadians are living longer and the difference in life expectancy between men and women is decreasing. The death rate for heart disease is considerably lower than before, thanks in large part to the important decrease in the number of people who smoke.\nThe bad news\nMore than 1 in 5 Canadian adults lives with a major chronic disease. As well, in the past 10 years, cancer surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death in Canada.\nDid you know?\n\n2.7 million Canadians are living with diabetes (types 1 and 2 combined), and that number keeps rising.\n2.3 million Canadians are living with heart disease.\nAlmost 2 million Canadians are living with a chronic respiratory disease.\nBetween 1999 and 2009, more than 800,000 Canadians received a cancer diagnosis.\nThere is a strong link between mental health and chronic disease: 1 in 25 Canadians over the age of 20 say they live with a mood and/or anxiety disorder and a major chronic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your knowledge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\n% \nShare Your Score!\n\n\n\n\nLet's recap\nCanadians are living longer, but many working\u00e2\u0080\u0093age Canadians are affected by a mood or anxiety disorder, and many live with one or more major chronic diseases. Levels of physical inactivity, sedentary behaviours and obesity continue to be high, especially in children and young adults.\nA health story does not start with a diagnosis; it starts much earlier. Four in five Canadian adults have at least one risk factor they can change. Positive behavior changes (like quitting smoking, being physically active, having healthy eating habits and consuming alcohol responsibly) at any age can improve overall health and well-being.\nFinally, being in good physical health is only part of the equation. Maintaining good mental and emotional health helps us solve problems and deal with life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenges. Reaching the right balance of physical and mental health means that the odds of leading a healthier and fuller life are on your side.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to know more?

Healthy, productive citizens reduce the burden on the health care system and contribute to a strong economy.\nIn general, Canada is a healthy nation. Over the past several decades, the overall mortality rate and life expectancy have improved considerably, and, in general, Canada compares well with the other developed nations.

Disruptions in activities, school, \n                    employment and supports have had a wide range of impacts on the well-being of Canadian families, parents and children, in particular, those with greater support needs, such as children with disabilities.\n                \n\n                    Using data from Statistics Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crowdsourcing questionnaire Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Parenting during the Pandemic, 2020, \n                    this data blog provides a snapshot of the experiences of parents who reported having children aged 0 to 14 years with cognitive, behavioural, or emotional disabilities \n                    during the early response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Information about the participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 characteristics by their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disability status is summarized in Table 5.\n\t\t\t\n\nWhat is the Public Health Agency of Canada doing to protect people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\t\t\t\tThe Public Health Agency of Canada has developed guidance on how to protect persons with disabilities and those that care for/support persons with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\t\t\t\tThis guidance includes strategies to minimize persons with disabilities and their carers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk of becoming infected, information on public health measures specific \n\t\t\t\tto persons with disabilities and advice on how to care for the physical and mental wellbeing of persons with disabilities and those that care for/support them during the pandemic. \n\t\t\t\tAdditional information on COVID-19 and people with disabilities in Canada is available.\n\t\t\t\n\nAbout the data\n\n\t\t\t\tData are from the crowdsourcing online questionnaire Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Parenting during the Pandemic, 2020. This questionnaire was designed \n\t\t\t\tto collect information on children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities, child care and school, parent employment status, and parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns for their family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall well-being \n\t\t\t\tduring COVID-19 pandemic. Parents of children aged 0 to 14 years living in Canada were invited to participate on a voluntary basis. Approximately 32,000 participants \n\t\t\t\tcompleted the survey from June 9 to 22, 2020.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCrowdsourcing data are not collected under a design using probability-based sampling therefore, findings based on these data are not generalizable \n\t\t\t\tto the overall Canadian population. However, a benchmarking factor based on demographic projections of the number of families with children aged \n\t\t\t\texclusively 0 to 5 or 6 to 14 years, or a mixture of both age groups, by province/territory as of January 2020 was used for every participant to \n\t\t\t\tcompensate for the over- or under-representation of the participants.1\n\nDive into the data\n\nTable 1 - Frequency with which children engaged in screen time at home\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable 1.

Similarly, fewer reported that their sense of belonging to their local community was somewhat or very strong in late 2020.\nBoth of these measures of positive mental health (\u00e2\u0080\u0098high self-rated mental health\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098high community belonging\u00e2\u0080\u0099) were even lower by early 2021. Lower average ratings of \u00e2\u0080\u0098life satisfaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099 during the pandemic were also reported.\nThere are also signs that psychological distress has risen. The percentage of adults who had seriously contemplated suicide (\u00e2\u0080\u0098recent suicide ideation\u00e2\u0080\u0099) was higher in early 2021 than in 2019. However, significant differences in recent suicide ideation were not seen in late 2020 compared to 2019.\nEveryone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life has been disrupted by the pandemic in some way, but some people have been impacted more than others. There were inequalities in mental health outcomes before the pandemic, which may have increased during the pandemic.\nTo better understand how mental health inequalities have changed in Canada, we conducted analyses to examine:\n\n\n                    differences in recent suicide ideation and positive mental health between sociodemographic groups:\n                    \nbefore the pandemic, using data from the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)\nduring the pandemic, using data from the 2020 and 2021 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (SCMH)\n\n\nwhether these differences have increased or decreased during the pandemic\n\nThe findings reveal a complex picture of inequality in the mental health of adults over time. See Table 1 for an overview of the results.\nHighlights\nThe magnitude of inequalities have increased for some sociodemographic characteristics, such as:\n\nAge\n\nBoth before and during the pandemic, young adults (18 to 34 years) and middle-aged adults (35 to 64 years) had lower average life satisfaction than older adults (aged 65+).\nYoung and middle-aged adults were also less likely than older adults at both time periods to have high self-rated mental health and community belonging.\nThese differences were even larger during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nRacialized group membership\n\nBefore the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among racialized adults (visible minorities and Indigenous identity) than among non-racialized adults. This difference was even larger during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nUrban/rural dwellers\n\nBefore the pandemic, there was no difference in high self-rated mental health between adults living in urban areas and those living in rural areas. However, differences emerged during the pandemic, with people in urban areas less likely to have high self-rated mental health.\nBefore the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among those living in urban areas. This difference increased during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nEnglish and French speakers in Quebec\n\nBefore the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among Anglophones than Francophones. This difference increased during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n Marital status\n\nBefore the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults who had never been married compared to those who were married or living common law. This difference was even larger during the pandemic.\n\n\nIn contrast, the magnitude of inequalities have decreased for some other sociodemographic characteristics, such as:\n\nHousehold income\n\nBefore the pandemic, adults in low-income households were less likely to have high self-rated mental health and community belonging than those in high-income households. These differences disappeared during the pandemic.\nBoth before and during the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults in low-income households than those in high-income households, but this difference decreased during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nBoth before and during the pandemic, adults with a high school education or less were less likely to have high self-rated mental health compared to those with a post-secondary education. However, this difference shrunk during the pandemic.\nBefore the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults with a high school education or less, compared to those with a post-secondary education. There was no difference between these groups during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nParents\n\nBefore the pandemic, adults with children under 18 had higher average life satisfaction and were more likely to have high self-rated mental health than those without children under 18. However, these differences disappeared during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nHousehold composition\n\nBefore the pandemic, adults living alone were less likely to have high self-rated mental health and community belonging compared to those living with others. However, these differences disappeared during the pandemic.\nBoth before and during the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults living alone than among those living with others. This difference was smaller during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nMarital status\n\nBoth before and during the pandemic, average life satisfaction was lower among adults who were separated, divorced or widowed than among those who were married or living common law. This difference shrunk during the pandemic.\n\n\nSummary table\nTable 1.

The Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health was conducted in 2020 and 2021 to better understand the self-reported mental health of adults aged 18 years and older in Canada during the pandemic, including suicidal ideation.Footnote 1,Footnote 2 Results of the survey were compared to the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey.\nMore adults in Canada reported suicidal ideation during the pandemic\nBefore the pandemic, in 2019, 2.7% of adults in Canada reported suicidal ideation. During the pandemic, 2.4% of adults reported suicidal ideation in fall 2020. This percentage rose significantly in spring 2021 to 4.2%.Footnote 3\nSome populations were more likely to report suicidal ideationFootnote 4\nSociodemographic groups\nReports of suicidal ideation were:\n\n9 times more likely among adults aged 18-34, and 4 times more likely among adults aged 35-64, compared to those 65 and over\n2 times more likely among adults born in Canada, compared to landed immigrants\n1.5 times more likely among adults living in urban areas, compared to those living in rural areas\n1.5 times more likely among adults with secondary school education or less, compared to those with post-secondary education\n1.5 more likely among adults living alone, compared to those living with others\n\nAdults who experienced pandemic-related impacts\nReports of suicidal ideation were:\n\n8 times more likely among those who experienced feelings of loneliness or isolation, compared to those who did not\n7 times more likely among those who experienced feelings of emotional distress, compared to those who did not\n4 times more likely among those who experienced issues with their physical health, compared to those who did not\n3 times more likely among those who experienced challenges in their personal relationships, compared to those who did not\n3 times more likely among those who experienced difficulties meeting their financial obligations, compared to those who did not\n2 times more likely among those who experienced loss of their job or income, compared to those who did not\n1.5 times more likely among those who experienced the death of family, friends, or colleagues, compared to those who did not\n\nAdditionally, the likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation increased with the number of pandemic-related impacts an individual experienced. Compared to those who experienced 1 impact or less, reports of suicidal ideation were 9 times higher in those who experienced 2 or more impacts and 25 times higher in those who experienced 6 or more impacts.\nAdults with symptoms of mental illness\nReports of suicidal ideation were:\n\n14 times more likely among adults with moderate to severe symptoms of major depressive disorder, compared to those without\n10 times more likely among adults with moderate to severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, compared to those without\n8 times more likely among adults with moderate to severe symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, compared to those without\n\nOther populations\nReports of suicidal ideation were:\n\n3 times more likely among those experienced stressful/traumatic events in their lifetime, compared to those who did not\n2 times more likely among those who reported increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, compared to those who did not\n2 times more likely among those who reported increased cannabis use during the pandemic, compared to those who did not\n2 times more likely among those who had concerns of violence in their own home, compared to those who did not\n2 times more likely among those who did not exercise to improve their health, compared to those who did\n\nAlthough an increase in suicidal ideation was observed in spring 2021, there is currently no evidence of an increased number of deaths by suicide since the pandemic beganFootnote 5. This could change as data are updated. Monitoring changes in the population over time using surveys and administrative data can help identify groups that are at increased risk of suicide and inform suicide prevention efforts.\nInformation about the data\nThe two cycles of Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health were conducted by Statistics Canada from September to December 2020 and February to May 2021. Participants were asked if they had seriously contemplated suicide since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey, participants were asked if they had seriously contemplated suicide in the past 12 months.\nHelp is available\nReading about suicide may bring about difficult emotions.

Most vaping devices have a battery, mouthpiece, heating element, and a chamber to hold vaping liquid which can contain nicotine.Footnote\u00a01 Some people also use vaping devices to consume cannabis. \nVaping has a risk of poisoning, burns and other unexpected health effects. Children have been poisoned by ingesting vaping liquid as it is often flavoured, making it more appealing; ingesting even a small amount of liquid nicotine can be serious and even life-threatening for a child.Footnote\u00a02 There are also reports of vaping device malfunctions, such as overheating batteries causing explosions and burns. In a nationally representative sample of US hospital emergency departments, one study found 26 cases of battery-related burns from vaping devices malfunctioning, which translates to a national estimate of 1007 cases.Footnote\u00a03\nOn May 23, 2018 Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA) came into effect allowing adults to legally access vaping products with nicotine.Footnote\u00a01 Although unregulated vaping products have been available for more than a decade,Footnote\u00a04 their manufacture, import, sale and advertisement are now subject to the TVPA as well as the Food and Drugs Act (FDA), Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA), and The Non-smoker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Act.Footnote\u00a01\nThe Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system currently operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 8 general hospitals across Canada. The numbers below are taken from an analysis of CHIRPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electronic database (eCHIRPP).Footnote\u00a05\nThe eCHIRPP database was searched for events (or cases) related to e-cigarettes and other vaping products, which occurred on or after April 1, 2011. A detailed search was conducted of nearly 60 English and French key words in patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 descriptions of the injury event, in combination with numerical codes. Below is a snapshot of our findings.\n\n\n\nHow many cases were there?\nThere were 32 reported cases of unintentional injuries or poisonings related to vaping products including e-cigarettes (6.2 cases/100,000 eCHIRPP records) between January 2013 and August 2018. No cases were reported before 2013. The frequency of cases increased over this time period from 2.0 cases to 13.0 cases/100,000 eCHIRPP records, with an annual increase of 16.6%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren and youth vs. adults\nThe age range of patients injured or poisoned from e-cigarettes and other vaping products was 0 to 49 years of age. Children and youth aged 0 to 14 years were most common at 7.1 cases/100,000 eCHIRPP records, compared to patients aged 15 to 49 at 2.8 cases/100,000 records.\nMales vs. females\nOverall, 62.5% of the patients injured or poisoned were male.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of injuries?\nSeventy-eight percent (78%) of the injuries reported were poisonings from ingesting vaping liquid, and 92% of those were among children aged 4 years or younger.  Among all ages, nearly two-thirds (64%) of the poisoning cases specified nicotine.\nThe remaining patients were burned from e-cigarettes exploding or catching fire (9%), or sustained another type of injury or had no injury detected (12%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere did the injuries and poisonings happen?\nMost (80.6%) injuries and poisonings occurred in private residences (i.e. the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own home, or someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home).\nWhat level of in-hospital treatment was needed?\nMore than two-thirds of patients (69%) had minor injuries or poisonings that did not require hospital admission or medical treatment, and who were therefore observed in the emergency department or received advice. Just over one-quarter (28%) of patients received medical treatment in the emergency department, and one fatality was reported.\n\n\n\nTake Note\nThe results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all vaping-related injuries and poisonings in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Teenagers older than 18 years of age, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously being entered into the eCHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data.\n\nMore information and related material\nLearn more about the  health risks of vaping products including e-cigarettes.\nLearn more about the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program.\nReport an incident with a vaping device.\n\nReferences\n\n Footnote 1 \n\nGovernment of Canada.

While there are numerous health benefits resulting from these sports and activities, there are also risks of serious injuries.reference1-3 These risks highlight the importance of personal safety, such as wearing appropriate clothing and safety equipment, and ensuring your gear is in good condition. For more information on winter safety tips, please visit the following sites:\n\nBe prepared for winter weather\nIce safety\nSports gear safety tips\nWinter outdoor safety\nSkiing and snowboarding safety tips\n\n\n\n\nThis data blog presents injury statistics on popular winter sports and activities captured in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) between October 1, 2016 and January 11, 2024. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system capturing injuries and poisonings presenting in 20 emergency departments across Canada. Every year, approximately 170,000 injury and poisoning records are entered in the database, from which information on the circumstances, types and emergency department outcomes of injuries can be examined. In this data blog, records with injuries related to sledding/tobogganing, ice skating, alpine skiing and snowboarding were examined.\n\n\n\nSledding/tobogganing\nIce skating\nAlpine skiing\nSnowboarding\n\n\n\n\nSledding/tobogganing\nIce skating\nAlpine skiing\nSnowboarding\n\n\n\n\nSledding/tobogganing:\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall\nBetween October 1, 2016 and January 11, 2024 there were 4,376 sledding/tobogganing-related injuries reported in the CHIRPP database, representing 556.0 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Of these injuries, the mean age was 10.0 years and males represented 54.4% of case. Among children, those aged 5 to 9 years represented nearly half of all cases at 43.6% (Table 1). Where reported, 7.5% (n = 327) of those injured stated that they were wearing safety equipment when the injury occurred.reference1\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This household item can pose a health risk to individuals, as metal bristles can detach from the brush and remain on the grill. If left unnoticed, these metal bristles can then be transferred to food and be consumed. Though rare, these injuries can result in serious health complications.\nThe numbers presented below are an updated analysis of such injuries using the  Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) surveillance system. The original analyses appeared in the October 2017 issue of the  Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention journal (Volume 37 No. 10).\n\n\n\n45 emergency department visits\nIncidents are still being detected. Between April 1, 2011 and April 30, 2024, there were 45 reported cases of injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation, representing 2.2 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Table 1 presents the annual distribution of such injuries captured in the CHIRPP database. \n\n\n\n\n\n    \t\t Table 1.

These include:\n\nEating burger, found barbecue brush bristle in mouth, feels like one in throat.\nPatient ingested some pins from the BBQ brush.\nEating barbecue pork, bristle from brush used to clean barbecue got lodged at base of tongue and adenoids. \nEating BBQ food; metal bristle from BBQ brush stuck on food; bristle stuck in esophagus. \nHad barbecued hamburger, brush bristle lodged in throat.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention\nCaution should be exercised when using metal bristle barbecue brushes due to the potential health and safety risks associated with metal bristles detaching and adhering to grills or cooked food items. To minimize the risk of issues with your metal bristle barbecue brush: \n\nregularly inspect your brush for signs of damage\ninspect grills and barbecued food for loose metal bristles\nreplace metal bristle barbecue brushes every season\nstop using your brush if metal bristles come loose or stick to the grill\nconsider buying a non-metal bristle barbecue brush as there are now many new alternatives being offered by retailers\n\nFor more information on barbecue brush safety and recall updates, please visit  Healthy Canadians.\n\nVoluntary safety standard \nIn an effort to reduce the health risks associated with metal bristle barbecue brushes, Health Canada and the Retail Council of Canada commissioned the Standards Council of Canada to develop new national voluntary safety standards for such products. A public review of the draft safety standard was conducted in the summer of 2019 and the \"CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes\" standard was released in December 2019.\nThe \"CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes\" standard provides requirements for the performance, testing, and marking of hand-held barbecue grill brushes with metal bristles and replacement heads. \nThe standard specifies requirements for: \n\nwire bristle tuft attachment strength\nwire bristle durability\nreplacement heads\npermanent on-product warning requirements\nrequirements for instructional literature\n\n\nAlthough the \"CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes\" standard is a voluntary standard, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to monitor incidents and injuries due to metal barbecue grill brushes. \n\n\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawn mower-related injuries\nA summary of statistics highlighting lawn mower-related injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoisonings and injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure\nA summary of statistics highlighting unintentional poisonings and injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure.\n\n\n\nAll Health Infobase data products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find what you were looking for?\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nIf not, tell us why:\n\n\nWhat was wrong?\n\n\n\n                                                The answer I need is missing\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                The information isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the right place\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                Something is broken or incorrect\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n                                                Other reason\n                                            \n\n\nPlease provide more details\n\n(Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include any personal information.

TBI mortality rates were highest for the oldest Canadians rising sharply among those 65 years of age and older.\nBetween 2002 and 2016, trends for males decreased slightly while female rates slightly increased. Some of the leading causes of TBI deaths were transportation collisions, falls among the elderly and suicide among males.\n\nHospitalizations\n\nBetween 2006/07 and 2017/18 there were 399,376 hospitalizations for head injuries, 63% (251,504) of which involved males. Over this period head injury trends for females showed a slight increase and for males a slight decrease. The leading cause of hospitalization for head injury was falls.\n\nEmergency Department Visits\n\nBetween 2002/03 and 2017/18 there were 5,074,239 ED visits for head injuries in Ontario and Alberta combined. For both males and females, TBI ED visits have been increasing since 2009/10. Falls and sports and recreation incidents are the leading causes of ED visits for TBI.\n\nSentinel surveillance of emergency department visits:\n\nSentinel surveillance of TBI show similar patterns to those reported from other sources.\nAn increasing trend in TBI for both males and females was observed over the period from 1990 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis report shows several situations where head injuries and TBI have declined over time and these declines have been linked to prevention initiatives. However, injury rates are still high and head injuries and TBI continue to be an important public health issue. As long as frequent and serious head injuries and TBI persist, the need for effective injury surveillance in support of prevention remains. Results from this report may be used to generate hypotheses for other studies, to highlight gaps in TBI/concussion surveillance and to help improve research and surveillance moving forward.\nPlease visit the bilingual Injury in Review, 2020 Edition: Spotlight on Traumatic Brain Injuries Across the Life Course on Canada.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2020-08-11\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "\nData Blog\n\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading our Data Blogs, a great way of getting quick facts, and the latest data, on different public health topics.\nLawn mower-related injuries Published: (2018-08-16)\nMowing the lawn is a routine, three season outdoor task for many people in Canada. Despite safety recommendations and the availability of protective clothing and equipment, lawn mower-related injuries still happen to people of all ages.\nThe Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is an injury and poisoning surveillance system currently operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 7 general hospitals across Canada. The numbers below are taken from an analysis of CHIRPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electronic database (eCHIRPP).\nAn extract of the eCHIRPP database was searched for records of unintentional lawn mower-related injuries which happened on or after April 1, 2011. These included incidents where patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 description of what went wrong contained the following key words and phrases:  lawnmower, lawn mower, mowing, cutting grass, cutting the grass or cutting the lawn. The French key words and phrases were searched as well. The eCHIRPP database was also searched for records with direct cause or factor codes for unpowered, powered walk-behind or ride-on lawn mowers, and lawn mowers that were not specifically classified as powered or unpowered.\n\n\n\nHow many cases were there?\nBetween April 2011 and June 2018, there were 512 unintentional injury cases related to lawn mowers (57.0 cases/ 100,000 eCHIRPP records). More than half (54%) of the cases were reported at two of the general hospitals reporting to CHIRPP.\nChildren and youth vs. adults\nLawn mower-related injuries were more common among adults than children and youth, and most common among people aged 50 to 64 years (Figure 1).\nMales vs. females\nOverall, 75.7% of the people injured were male.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the injuries happen?\nThe most common circumstance of injury among all ages was the operator cutting their hand or foot (including traumatic amputation) under a mower that was turned on (Table 1). When looking at children aged 14 years and under the most common circumstance was getting burned from touching the hot motor or exhaust, at nearly a third of cases in that age group (Table 2).\nTop 3 most common injuries\nUp to three specific injuries for each case can be reported in CHIRPP, with the first being the most serious. Among the most serious, specific injuries reported, the top three most common were:\n\nOpen wounds including minor cuts and lacerations (29.4%)\nFractures (13.5%)\nTraumatic amputations, including partial amputation (11.3%), and Burn or corrosion (11.3%)\n\nNearly all traumatic amputations (and partial) were to fingers, toes, or feet, with the exception of fewer than five cases involving the hands or lower leg (including when more than one amputation was reported).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich body parts were injured?\nUp to three specific body parts for each case can be reported in CHIRPP, corresponding with types of injuries reported. Among the most serious injuries reported, the top three most common body parts injured were: \n\nFinger, hand (30.4%)\nToes, foot, ankle (18.3%)\nHead, face (including eyes), neck (16.8%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat level of in-hospital treatment was needed?\nOverall, 71.6% of patients received medical treatment in the emergency department, while another 14.6% of patients had injuries serious enough to be admitted to hospital for treatment. The remaining patients with less serious injuries either left without being seen by a physician, were under observation only, received advice in the emergency department about their injuries, or were admitted for a reason other than injury treatment. No fatalities were reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas any special safety equipment or protective clothing being used?\nThe use of safety equipment was reported in 11.7% of cases, while another 68.6% of cases reported no use of safety equipment or protective clothing. It was unknown in the remaining 19.7% of cases. Up to five safety equipment items may be reported for each case. More than half (50.5%) of the safety equipment reported was protective boots or clothing, and another third (32.2%) was protective eyewear.\n\n\n\nDive into the Data\nFigure 1. Frequency distribution of injury cases related to lawn mowers, by age group, per 100,000 records*, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2018\n\n\n\n*Counts per 100,000 records are normalized to all eCHIRPP cases in each age to account for the uneven age distribution in the eCHIRPP database, given that there are more paediatric than general hospitals reporting to CHIRPP. Note that 369 cases in the eCHIRPP database had missing age group information.\nTable 1. Circumstances of lawn mower-related injury cases among all ages, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2018\n\n*Other includes struck by a motor vehicle, flame or electrical burn, fainting, or playing with a stationary mower.\nTable 2. Circumstances of lawn mower-related injury cases among children and youth aged 14 and under, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2018\n\n*Other includes: Cut/struck by component other than blades, or cut not further specified; playing with a stationary mower; fell off/ejected from a riding mower (including when overturned); injured while repairing/maintaining mower that was off; struck an obstacle (e.g., hit branch, stepped on rusty nail); lost footing/fell while operating mower; sprain/strain/awkward movement while operating mower; injured while moving/loading or unloading mower; boarding/alighting mower; flame or electrical burn.\nTake Note\nThe injuries described here do not represent all lawn mower-related injuries in Canada because CHIRPP collects data at only a sample of hospitals in Canada. In addition to older teen and adults, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, because most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Because of the dynamic nature of eCHIRPP, information is still being entered into the database, so some years do not yet have complete data.\n\nLearn more about safety around gardening tools and equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2018-08-16\n\n\n\n"

The CCAHS covers the period from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until August 31, 2022. A random sample of Canadian adults were surveyed between April 1 and August 31, 2022. The questionnaire asked about new or continuing symptoms 3 or more months after a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19.\nA follow-up survey (CCAHS-FQ) of adults who had participated in the CCAHS was conducted. The follow-up survey collected information about longer-term symptoms after confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.   \nWe used data from these surveys to produce the reports highlighted here. The first and second reports used data from the CCAHS while the third report used data from the CCAHS-FQ. \n\nHighlights of the third report (Fall 2023)\nThe third report, Experiences of Canadians with long-term symptoms following COVID-19, was a collaboration between Statistics Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. It was published in the fall of 2023 in the journal Insights on Canadian Society. It provides information on adults who had COVID-19 and their experiences with longer-term symptoms and healthcare, as well as the vaccination status of all adults.\nSince this report was based on data from the CCAHS-FQ, estimates may differ from those published earlier.\nThe survey revealed that as of June 2023:\n\n64.4% of adults reported having had COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) and 19.8% of adults reported more than 1 infection.\n19% of infected adults (3.5 million people), had longer-term symptoms.\n58.2% of adults in Canada who had longer-term symptoms (2.1 million people), continued to have them.\nAbout 600,000 adults in Canada had missed time from work or school due to longer-term symptoms. On average they missed 24 days.\nAbout 100,000 adults were unable to return to work or school because of their longer-term symptoms.\n66.4% of adults who sought healthcare services reported not receiving any treatment, services or support for any of their longer-term symptoms.\n49.2% of all adults had received 4 or more COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nThe survey also showed that adults who had had COVID-19 multiple times were more likely to report longer-term symptoms:\n\n14.6% of adults with 1 infection reported longer-term symptoms compared to 37.9% of adults with 3 or more infections.\n\nHighlights of the second report (Spring 2023)\nThe second report, Associations between Longer-term Symptoms after COVID-19 and Sociodemographics, Health Characteristics, Period of Infection, and Vaccination Status in Canadian Adults, January 2020 to August 2022, was published in the Spring of 2023. It looked at which groups of adults were more likely to report longer-term symptoms. It also explored risk and protective factors. Since this report was based on the latest CCAHS data, some estimates may differ from those published earlier.\nThe survey revealed that 17.2% of adults experienced longer-term symptoms after having had COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected), and that certain groups were more likely to report longer-term symptoms, including those who:\n\nwere female\n                        \n22% of females reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 12.5% of males.\n\n\nhad one or more pre-existing chronic conditions\n                        \n37.4% of adults with 4 or more pre-existing chronic conditions reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 12.8% of adults with no chronic conditions. \n\n\nlived with obesity\n                        \nOver 27% of adults with mid to upper range obesity reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 16.2% of adults with normal weight (based on body mass index).\n\n\nlived with a disability\n                        \n28.3% of adults with a disability reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 16.3% of adults without a disability. \n\n\nhad more severe initial COVID-19 symptoms\n                        \n44.7% of adults who were hospitalized for COVID-19 reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 2.3% of adults with no initial symptoms. \n\n\n\nThe survey also showed that longer-term symptoms were more common among adults who were:\n\ninfected earlier in the pandemic\n                        \nOver 26% of adults infected before July 2021 reported longer-term symptoms, compared to less than 15% of those infected between July 2021 and May 2022.\n\n\nunvaccinated\n                        \n25% of adults who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vaccinated before having COVID-19 reported longer-term symptoms, compared to 13.2% of those with 2 vaccine doses and 12.2% of those with 3 vaccine doses.\n\n\n\nThe results presented in this publication are consistent with other studies on longer-term symptoms after getting COVID-19. \n\nHighlights of the first report (Fall 2022)\nThe first report, Frequency and impact of longer-term symptoms following COVID-19 in Canadian adults, was published in the Fall of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n14.8%\n\n\nof adults with a confirmed or suspected infection experienced longer-term COVID-19 symptoms\n\n\n\n\n47.3%\n\n\nof adults who experienced longer-term COVID-19 symptoms experienced symptoms for a year or longer\n\n\n\n\n21.3%\n\n\nof adults who experienced longer-term COVID-19 symptoms said that their symptoms often or always limited their daily activities\n\n\nLonger-term symptoms were more common among females (18%) than males (11.6%), and among those who reported severe symptoms when they first got sick (36.4%).\nAmong adults with longer-term symptoms, the most common were:\n\nfatigue, tiredness or loss of energy (72.1%)\ncoughing (39.3%)\nshortness of breath or difficulty breathing (38.5%)\ndifficulty thinking or problem solving (32.9%)\ngeneral weakness (30.9%)\n\nAmong adults with longer-term symptoms who were employed or attending school, approximately three-quarters (74.1%) missed some work or school due to their symptoms. On average, they missed 20 days.\nThese  results are consistent with those from other surveys and international evidence.\nOther initiatives about longer-term symptoms\nThe Government of Canada is trying to better understand and address the longer-term health impacts of COVID-19.  In addition to the CCAHS, other efforts include investments in research through the:\n\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research\nTask Force on Post COVID-19 condition\n\nFor more information, please visit our post COVID-19 condition page.\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 epidemiology update\nDetailed data about the spread of virus over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination\nNumber of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in Canada.\n\n\n\nAll Health Infobase data products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find what you were looking for?\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nIf not, tell us why:\n\n\nWhat was wrong?\n\n\n\n                                                    The answer I need is missing\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    The information isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the right place\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    Something is broken or incorrect\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                    Other reason\n                                                \n\n\nPlease provide more details\n\n(Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include any personal information.

While its benefits are typically thought of as reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, active transportation is also a crucial way that many Canadians achieve daily physical activity. Physical activity has many physical and mental health benefits, including chronic disease preventionFootnote 1. In 2018, Canadian adults reported using an active form of transportation for an average of 1.7 hours per weekFootnote 1.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) developed the Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour and Sleep (PASS) Indicators, consisting of 55 indicators that together help build a picture of the PASS behaviours of CanadiansFootnote 2. The PASS Indicators include several indicators related to active transportation.\nEvidence shows that the safer an individual feels on their cycling route, the more likely they are to cycleFootnote 3. This can be particularly true for those who are less confident cycling, and could reduce a barrier for individuals to begin cyclingFootnote 4. Bicycling infrastructure is often built to keep riders safe, but not all types of infrastructure provide equal levels of safetyFootnote 5. PHAC is currently working to develop a surveillance indicator to better understand bicycling infrastructure across the country. Open data provides one possible information source for reporting on this indicator.\nOpen-Data\nOpen-data refers to data that is free to access, use, modify, and shareFootnote 6. A growing number of Canadian municipalities have created open-data portals as a way to publish their data on a range of topics and make it accessible for all. These open-data datasets can be rich sources of information that can be leveraged for many uses, including public health. Datasets that include the location and types of bicycling infrastructure within municipalities are relatively common. The purpose of this investigation is to test the potential of using open-data on bicycling infrastructure to create a new PASS Indicators measure for active transportation infrastructure.\nMost municipalities have their own data portals, so gathering every active transportation dataset across Canada would require identifying each municipality with a portal and searching it for relevant data. As a first step in determining if such data could be used for a national indicator, this investigation explored open-data from the two largest municipalities within each Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Canada. Bicycling infrastructure data was not available for every municipality considered, indicating that there are gaps in the data. The municipalities for which data was obtained accounted for approximately 42% of the Canadian population. The nomenclature used in each dataset differed between municipalities but was kept in this tool in order to show the data as it is provided.\n\nDive into the data\n\nSelect a municipality from the list at the top of the tool to view that municipality\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrastructure.\nSelect the toggle switch at the bottom of the tool to switch between the map view and graph view.\nWhile in the graph view hover over each bar to show the total length of each type of infrastructure and the average length infrastructure segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\n\n\n Chart\nMap \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\nThrough this exploration of available open-data, bicycle infrastructure information was identified for 26 municipalities, accounting approximately 42% of the Canadian population.\nThe availability and quality of this data suggests that open-data is a viable data source for the development of a measure of the amount of bicycling infrastructure across Canada.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe publication date of each dataset varied by municipality, the earliest being from June 2013 and the latest from August 2018, so newbuilt infrastructure may not be reflected.\nFrom the 26 municipalities included, there were a total of 106 unique labels for bikeway infrastructure. This variation in nomenclature likely does not reflect the variation in infrastructure, and is an obstacle for cities to compare and learn from each other.\nDefinitions for different types of bikeways varied between municipalities, so direct comparisons between cities should be considered with caution.\n\nNext steps\nPHAC funded the development of a simplified naming convention for bicycling infrastructure, the Canadian Bikeway Comfort and Safety (Can-BICS) classification systemFootnote 7. Can-BICS was created to help bring consistency to the variation of names currently employed for cycling infrastructure, and streamline the process of developing a PASS Indicators measure of the amount of bicycling infrastructure by type across municipality.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada.

When more than 1 chemical is selected in the drop-down menu, the percentage represents the total of all the chemicals selected. Each sample is analyzed for more than 190 different compounds, so multiple chemicals can be detected in a single sample. This is reflected in the percentage calculated. (For example, if only 1 chemical is detected in a sample, the percentage would be calculated as 1/190*100 = 0.5%.  If 2 chemicals were detected in a sample, the percentage would be calculated as 2/190*100 = 1.1%.) \nExceedance frequency: The percentage of the selected chemical(s) with concentration(s) above the lowest HHRV or ALRV in a given sample. For simplicity, we presented the data by sample rather than by individual chemical.\nAcute Invertebrate ALRV: An estimate of short-term concentrations below which aquatic invertebrates are unlikely to experience severe adverse effects such as death.\nChronic Invertebrate ALRV: An estimate of long-term concentrations below which aquatic invertebrates are unlikely to experience adverse effects. Small exceedances for short periods of time will probably not cause harm. \nAcute Fish ALRV: An estimate of short-term concentrations below which fish are unlikely to experience severe adverse effects such as death.\nChronic Fish ALRV: An estimate of long-term concentrations below which fish are unlikely to experience adverse effects. Small exceedances for short periods of time will probably not cause harm.\nNon-vascular Plant ALRV: A concentration of a pesticide below this level is unlikely to harm non-vascular plants such as algae. \nVascular Plant ALRV:A concentration of a pesticide below this level is unlikely to harm vascular plants such as duckweed.\nAcute HHRV: A person drinking water with a concentration of a pesticide at or below this value is unlikely to experience health effects. Use short-term HHRVs when exposure is limited to 1 day.\nChronic HHRV: A person drinking water with a concentration of a pesticide at or below the long-term HHRV over a lifetime is unlikely to experience health effects. Small exceedances above the long-term value for short periods of time are also unlikely to cause harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of sampling sites \n\nClick, zoom, or drag the map to see the sampling sites.

They include generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, among others.\nAlthough mood and anxiety disorders are distinct, one person will often experience both. Each of these disorders can have a major impact on a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life and as a result, are a significant public health challenge in Canada. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why The Public Health Agency of Canada works with provinces, territories and national organizations to monitor and report on the burden, the wide ranging impacts, and the trends of these disorders in order to better inform prevention efforts and health care services in Canada.\nHere are some of our findings:\n\n\n\n1 in 10\nMore than 1 in 10 Canadians aged 18+ report having a mood and/or anxiety disorder. [SLCDC, 2014]\n3.5 million\nEvery year, close to 3.5 million Canadians use health services for mood and/or anxiety disorders, of which 258,000 are children and youth (1-19 years). [CCDSS, 2016]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3/4\nRoughly three-quarters of Canadians who use health services for a mental illness in a given year use them for mood and/or anxiety disorders. [CCDSS, 2016]\nx2\nMood and anxiety disorders are more common among women than men. [O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell et al, 2015]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30-54 years old\nThe age group that uses health services for mood and/or anxiety disorders the most is middle-aged Canadian adults (30-54 years), followed by older adults (55 years and older). [CCDSS, 2016]\n35%\nOver one-third of working Canadians diagnosed with a mood and/or anxiety disorder(s) say they had to stop work at some point because of their disorder(s).  [SLCDC, 2014]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65%\nFamily doctors are the most consulted health professional for mood and anxiety disorders (65%) followed by non-physician health professionals (35%), including psychologists and social workers, counselors, psychotherapists.

Mosquitoes are usually active in Canada between spring and fall. This update provides the most recent data for humans, mosquito pools, and other animals reported to PHAC. There is no equivalent seasonal updates for tick-borne diseases.\n\nAbout One Health\nPHAC uses a One Health approach, which recognizes the interdependence of human health, animal health and their shared environment. Vector-borne diseases are increasing due to warmer temperatures and range expansion of mosquito and tick habitats.\n\nWest Nile virus (WNV)\nFigure 1.

Although adult obesity in Canada has been\r\n\t\t\t\trelatively steady since 2004, the percentage of adults who are obese today is twice as high as it was in 1978-1979, from\r\n\t\t\t\t13.8%\r\n\t\t\t\tFootnote\u00a01 to 28.2% (Table 2). This is concerning since obesity is a known risk factor for chronic diseases like diabetes or hypertension.\nWhen are people considered obese?\nPeople are considered obese if they have too much fat on their body that can negatively affect their health. This is usually measured using the Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight in kilograms by their height in metres, squared. A BMI of 30 kg/m\r\n\t\t\t\tFootnote\u00a02 or higher is considered\r\n\t\t\t\tobese for adults aged 18 and over. A BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m\r\n\t\t\t\tFootnote\u00a02 is considered\r\n\t\t\t\toverweight.\r\n\t\t\t\nBut like health, developing obesity is a complex process influenced by different factors. Biology (like sex or\r\n\t\t\t\tgenetic make-up), behaviours (like physical activity and diet), as well as mental health are important factors. In addition, where someone lives, their income, social relationships and personal\r\n\t\t\t\tidentity can all influence behaviour and mental state and thus, also play an important role.\nSo with this in mind, what are the numbers telling us about obesity in adults?\n\n\n\n\nDemographic Factors\nOver the past decade, when comparing men and women, there has been little to no difference in obesity between them.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor both, the percentage of people that are obese has remained more or less unchanged. While obesity rates increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith age, it seems to level off around middle-age (Table 1).\nIncome adequacy takes into account the number of people living in a household and the amount of income available to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport them. Some of the factors that contribute to obesity (like diet, sleep, mental health and well-being, etc.)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare impacted by income level (Table 2 and Table 3).\nWhile the overall rate of obesity among Canadian adults is 28.2%, it can vary a lot based on where someone lives (e.g.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thealth region) [see map].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifestyle Factors\nEating Behaviours\n\nCanadian adults think their eating habits are \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery good\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the majority of them eat their main meal at the family table (92.4%; CCHS 2012 Food Skills Rapid Response). However, most adults do not use the Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Guide when doing their grocery shopping (69.5%; CCHS 2012 Food Skills Rapid Response) yet many have habits that help them make healthy choices. For instance, most use a grocery list (73.2%) or read nutrition labels (63.3%) [CCHS 2012 Food Skills Rapid Response]. In general, normal weight adults eat healthier (41.7%) than those who are obese (34.2%) [Table 2]. That said, only 39.3% of Canadian adults actually maintain a healthy diet  (Table 2).\nCurrent health advice suggests that drinking fewer sugary drinks is part of a healthy lifestyle that contributes to a healthier weight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a02. Although only a small percent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof adults (12.8%) say they drink one or more sugar-sweetened drinks per day, specifically regular soft drinks, sports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrinks or fruit-flavoured drinks (Table 2), the sales of new sugary drinks like energy drinks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflavoured waters, and sweetened coffees have increased dramatically in Canada with sweetened coffees alone increasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t579% between 2004 and 2015\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a03. Drinking sugar-sweetened drinks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis higher among younger adult Canadians but this decreases with age (Table 2).\n\nActivity Behaviours\n\nBeing physically active is important to health, yet only 22.2% of Canadian adults are active enough (Table 2).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, the majority of Canadians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 waking hours (9.8 hours per day) are spent on activities that are sedentary (which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans that they require very little movement) such as sitting at a desk or watching television (Table 2).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOnly a small percentage of adults take active forms of transportation, like walking or cycling, to get to and from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir workplace (19.8% walk and 4.1% bike; CCHS 2014).\nOver the past few decades, as the amount of sleep adults get has gone down (from 8.0 hours per night in 1992\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a04 to 7.2 hours per night in 2013-2014;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable 2), obesity has gone up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a05. Current research shows that 64.5%\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Canadian adults do get adequate sleep\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a06, but this can vary by age group\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (Table 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychosocial Factors\nA person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental state and social relationships can play a part in the development of obesity, but can also be affected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby excess weight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a07,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a08. At all ages, there is widespread\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscrimination towards those considered obese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a06. Binge eating, which can cause\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweight gain, has been linked with depression and lower self-esteem, and is often used as a way of coping with stress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFootnote\u00a08. Among Canadian adults, a higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of obese adults report being depressed or having a mood disorder (11.0%) compared to overweight (7.0%) or normal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweight (6.9%) adults (Table 3).\nYour identity is how you see yourself, your appearance, abilities and uniqueness. Obesity can have an impact on this.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tObese adults report feeling happy less often (93.0%) and are less likely to report being in very good or excellent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thealth (45.1%) than adults who are not obese (95.1% and 68.3%) [Table 3]. However, when looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outlook on life, both normal weight and obese adults report similar feelings about their sense of community\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(62.4% and 58.1%) and that they had trusting relationships (95.7% and 95.4%) (Table 3). Interestingly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta higher number of overweight adults report feeling a sense of community (71.1%) and that they had trusting relationships\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(96.3%) compared to obese or normal weight adults (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Into the Data\n\n\n Use the map below to discover the obesity rate in Canada's health regions.

This public health crisis is having a tragic impact on people who use substances, their families, and communities across the country, and is shaped by a wide range of factors. The COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated the crisis, as several jurisdictions reported higher rates of fatal overdoses and other harms following the onset of the pandemic.\nPresented here are the most recent available data on opioid and stimulant-related overdoses and deaths  in Canada, where available.

It occurs when the loss of bone tissue is faster than normal, causing it to become weak and break (fracture) easily. Often people are not aware they have osteoporosis until they have a fracture.  The most common areas for fractures include the wrist, shoulder, spine, pelvis and hip, with hip fractures being the most serious.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) works with partners and provides information about osteoporosis to help Canadians understand the importance of avoiding the bone thief and building strong bones for life. Visit the Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website to learn more.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n2.1 million\nAbout 2.1 million (or 12% of) Canadians who are 40 years and older have received a diagnosis of osteoporosis. [PHAC]\n5x\nWomen 40 years of age and older are five times more likely than men to be diagnosed with osteoporosis. [PHAC]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n150 per 100,000 annually\nEach year there are about 150 hip fractures per 100,000 Canadians 40 years of age and older. [PHAC]\n31%\nAlmost one third (31%) of the people who have suffered a hip fracture die within the following year. Interestingly, there is a significant difference between the mortality rate of men and women. While 28% of women who have suffered a hip fracture die within the following year, 37% of men suffer the same fate. [Jiang HX et al., 2005]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n< 1/2\nGetting enough calcium and vitamin D through diet or supplements, as well as regular exercise are recommended for the prevention of osteoporosis. However, among Canadians 40 years of age and older, less than half reported taking both calcium and vitamin D supplements (32%) and engaging in regular physical activity (43%). [PHAC]\n< 20%\nDespite the high rate of fragility fractures in the Canadian population, less than 20% undergo diagnosis or receive treatment for osteoporosis.  Men are less likely than women to receive an intervention. [Bessette L et al., 2008] [Leslie WD et al., 2012]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80% vs 15%\nA fracture is to osteoporosis what a heart attack is to cardiovascular disease. The care gap is far greater after a fracture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about 80% receive beta blockers (that slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure) to help prevent recurrent heart attack, compared to 15% that receive an anti-osteoporosis medication following a fragility fracture.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that carries signals between nerves in the brain and controls the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements.\nDecreasing amounts of dopamine to the brain can lead to the four main motor symptoms of Parkinson disease:\n\nShaking\nMuscle stiffness\nSlow movement\nDifficulty with balance and posture\n\nIndividuals living with this disease may also experience various non-motor symptoms. [Parkinson Canada, 2022]\nIn collaboration with all Canadian provinces and territories, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) collects, analyzes and shares data on diagnosed parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, through the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS). This information aids the planning and evaluation of health policies, programs and services.\n\n\n\n\nWho is affected?\nAround 91,000\nThe number of Canadians aged 40 years and older living with diagnosed parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, in 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017. [CCDSS, 2021]\nOver 1.5X\nAdjusting for age, parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, is over 1.5 times more common in men than in women. [CCDSS, 2021]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 11,000\nThe number of Canadians aged 40 years and older newly diagnosed with parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease, in 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017. [CCDSS, 2021]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the health impacts?\n23%\nAlmost a quarter of Canadians with Parkinson disease also report living with a mood disorder. [Mapping Connections, 2014]\n43%\nApproximately 43% of Canadians aged less than 65 years living with Parkinson disease are permanently unable to work. [Mapping Connections, 2014]\n\t1/2\nAbout half of all Canadians living with Parkinson disease report mobility limitations. [Mapping Connections, 2014]\n\n\n\nThere is currently no cure for Parkinson disease, but treatments are available to help mitigate its symptoms and health impacts. For more information on treatments and therapies, talk to a health care provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2022-04-26\n\n\n\n"

data includes women from age 15-54 (CIHI) or age 15-55 (CCHS) who gave birth during a specified time period.\n\na Data from CCHS is self-reported.b Age-specific, birth rates for mothers: The denominators for the age-specific rate of live births were population estimates for the corresponding age category for the specific calendar year.c Severe Maternal Morbidities: The 14 categorized types include: Severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome; Postpartum hemorrhage with RBC transfusion or procedures to the uterus or hysterectomy; Maternal ICU admission; Hysterectomy; Complications of obstetric surgery and procedures; Repair of bladder, urethra or intestine; Puerperal sepsis; Assisted Ventilation through endotracheal tube; Cardiac Conditions Curettage with RBC transfusion; Acute Renal Failure; Eclampsia; Obstetric Shock; Placenta previa with hemorrhage with RBC transfusion.d Total births include live births and stillbirths.e Preterm Birth Rate: This indicator is defined as the number of live births with a gestational age at birth of less than 37 completed weeks (<259 days), expressed as a proportion of all live births. Limitation of data on preterm birth is error in reporting of gestational age, particularly when it is based on menstrual dates. These errors have diminished in recent decades as ultrasound confirmation of gestational age is widely used across Canada; however, dating ultrasounds performed in the first trimester are more accurate than in the second trimester. f SGA and LGA: The small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birth rates are defined as the number of live births for which birth weight is below the 10th percentile, or above the 90th percentile, respectively, for sex-specific birth weight for gestational age, expressed as a proportion of all singleton live births.g Fetal Mortality Rate: This indicator is defined as the number of stillbirths, per 1000 total births (live births and stillbirths), and is recorded through CIHI to include all registered stillbirths (no evidence of life upon birth). Those requiring registration (in all provinces or territories, excluding Quebec) include stillbirths following pregnancy termination, with a birth weight \u2265500 g or a gestational age at delivery \u226520 weeks.h  Crude infant mortality rates are calculated from all births weighing at least 500g, and includes neonatal and postneonatal deaths. Infant Mortality Rate: This indicator is defined as the number of deaths of live born babies in the first year after birth per 1,000 live births. Infant deaths can be subdivided into neonatal deaths (0\u201327 days) and postneonatal deaths (28\u2013364 days).\n\n\nSuggested Citation: \r\n                    Centre for Surveillance and Applied Research, Public Health Agency of Canada.

CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system capturing injuries and poisonings presenting in 21 emergency departments across Canada. Every year, approximately 170,000 injury and poisoning records are entered in the database, from which information, such as the circumstances and types of injuries can be examined. This data blog then concludes by providing important prevention safety measures to reduce the risks of being exposed to CO. \n\n\n\r\n                    What is carbon monoxide poisoning?\r\n                \nCO poisoning is a significant public health concern in Canada responsible for an estimated 300 deaths and 200 hospitalizations each yearFootnote 1. Considered as a leading cause of unintentional poisoning deaths in CanadaFootnote 2, CO is a poisonous gas that is undetectable by our senses because it has no smell, no colour and no taste; this makes it difficult to recognize its presence and emphasizes the importance of installing CO alarms in indoor spaces.\nCharacteristics of carbon monoxide:\n\nNo smell\nNo colour\nNo taste\n\n\nHow is carbon monoxide produced?\nCO is produced when hydrocarbon fuels such as charcoal, wood, gasoline, natural gas or propane are burned incompletely. The poor maintenance, installation and ventilation of fuel burning appliances and equipment, such as fireplaces, gas ovens and generators can lead to the dangerous buildup of CO gas in indoor spaces, including kitchens, garages and living rooms.\n\n\n\r\n                    Common sources of carbon monoxide includeFootnote 3:\r\n                \n\nIndoor cooking and household appliances (gas ranges, woodstoves, gas washers and dryers)\nOutdoor appliances (barbecues, gas lamps, camping stoves)\nNonelectric combustion based heating systems (furnaces, gas water heaters, fuel burning space heaters, fireplaces) \nGas-powered tools (chain saws, compressors, lawn mowers, snowblowers)\nGas powered portable generators\nIdling vehicles with combustion engines (car, motorcycle, ATV, snowmobile)\nTobacco smoke\nFire\n\n\n\nBe aware of the symptoms of CO poisoningFootnote 4Footnote 5:\nThe early signs of mild to moderate CO poisoning are similar to the flu or food poisoning (except no fever), and some common symptoms include:\n\nHeadache\nShortness of breath\nFatigue\nDizziness\nNausea\n\nHigher levels of CO poisoning can, however, lead to worse and life-threatening symptoms, including:\n\nVomiting\nLoss of consciousness\nComa\nDeath\n\n\nCarbon monoxide-related cases in CHIRPP\nAs presented in Table 1, between April 1, 2011 and June 15, 2023, there were 767 unintentional CO-related events reported in the CHIRPP database, representing 42.6 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Of these events, the mean age was 17.5 years; males represented 55.1% of cases (n = 423), and children aged 0 to 4 years represented the highest percentage among age groups at 24.3% (n = 184). Nearly two-third of cases (63.6%) occurred during the colder seasons of Canada: fall and winter. Work-related incidents involving CO exposure accounted for 10.6% of cases (n = 81). There were 150 incidents that resulted in two or more patients presenting in the emergency departments \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these incidents involved 458 patients in total.\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTable 1.

Of note, among 12.1% of cases (n = 93), no injuries or poisonings were detected following assessments at the emergency departments. In terms of outcomes, the majority of patients required observations and treatments in the emergency departments at 37.1% and 31.9%, respectively. Approximately 6.9% of patients were admitted to the hospital (Table 2).  \n\n\n\r\nTable 2.

Among the 49 reports, 43 described events in Canada. These reports also noted 34 instances of reported fatalities and 15 reported injuries related to CO poisoning. \nThe top 3 product categories reported include:\n\nKitchen appliances (n = 15)\nHeating and cooling appliances (n = 13)\nGenerators (n = 12)\n\nAdditionally, there are approximately 150 possible cases of CO poisoning reported from media sources. Due to limited information available in these reports, involvement of CO poisoning is suspected but could not be confirmed and location will vary.\n\nPrevention: Reduce the risks of carbon monoxide exposure\nCO poisoning is preventable. Below are some important safety measures that may help reduce the risks of being exposed to CO:\n\n\n\n\r\n                    Safety characteristics and specific guidance that may help reduce the risks of being exposed to CO:\r\n                \n\n\n\nSafety item/characteristic\nGuidance and recommendations\n\n\n\n\nCarbon monoxide alarms\nInstall CO alarms that are certified to meet Canadian safety standards on every level of your home, especially closer to sleeping areas. Be sure to test them regularly and replace the batteries as recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\nFuel-burning appliances\nMake sure all fuel-burning appliances are properly installed, maintained, and vented to the outside. Keep vents and chimneys clear of debris and snow, and never block them. Ventilation should not recycle air back into the room. \n\n\nMaintenance of fuel-burning appliances\nMaintain and inspect fuel-burning appliances including furnaces, boilers, water heaters, gas stoves and fireplaces by a qualified technician annually to ensure proper functioning.\n\n\nFuel-burning appliances and enclosed spaces\nNever use a portable fuel-burning appliance, such as a camping stove, generator, or charcoal grill indoors or in an enclosed space, such as a garage, basement, tent or camper. \n\n\nMotor vehicles and gas-powered equipment\nNever run a motor vehicle or gas-powered equipment inside a garage attached to your house even if the garage door is left open.\n\n\nKnow the symptoms\nBe attentive to possible symptoms of CO poisoning, particularly if multiple household members are experiencing similar symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Action: What to do if you suspect CO exposure\n\nEvacuate the property immediately and move to an area with fresh air.\nCall 9-1-1 without delay.\nDo not go back inside. Wait for the approval of emergency services responders before re-entering the premises.\n\n\nLimitations\nThe results presented above do not represent all CO-related injuries and poisonings in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, M\u00c3\u00a9tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years may not have complete data. \n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nCohen I, Garis L, Rajabali F, Pike I.

Positive mental health is a state of well-being that allows us to feel, think, and act in ways that enhance our ability to enjoy life and deal with the challenges we face.The PMHSIF contains a core set of indicators organized into five categories: positive mental health outcomes and four domains of risk and protective factors (individual, family, community and society). Each indicator has a corresponding measure. For each measure in the PMHSIF, pan-Canadian estimates are available for adults aged 18 and older, and youth aged 12 \u201317 years, along with breakdowns by key demographic and socioeconomic variables. A Framework for children is under development.For a quick overview of the PMHSIF, click on any of the domains listed below. A list of all indicators and  measures within the domain, for adults (aged 18 and older) and youth (aged 12 \u201317 years), with their corresponding pan-Canadian estimates, will unfold. Additionally, a detailed description of each measure can be obtained by clicking on the \u201cDescription\u201d link next to each measure.

In 2012, the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention Act became legislation in Canada and led to the development of the 2016 Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention. The Framework is focused on raising awareness and reducing stigma, better connecting people to information and resources, and accelerating innovation and research to prevent suicide. \nIn light of the Framework, the Public Health Agency of Canada championed the dissemination of statistics on suicide and related risk factors through the development of the Suicide Surveillance Indicator Framework (SSIF).

There is no better time to start testing your home and ensuring that the air you breathe is safe for you and your family.\n\n\n\nWhat is radon and where can I find it?\nRadon is an invisible radioactive gas that causes lung cancer. In Canada, it is the second highest cause of lung cancer, after smoking. It comes from the ground and is produced by the breakdown of the mineral uranium that occurs naturally in the soil. As uranium breaks down, it eventually releases radon. Radon is a gas, so it travels easily through the soil, working its way toward the surface.\nWhen radon escapes into outdoor air, the concentrations are low (approximately 15 Bq/m3).  However, radon also escapes into our homes wherever they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in contact with the soil, finding its way in through cracks or around pipes and drains. Here in Canada, our homes are well sealed to keep us warm in the winter, and so the radon concentration in our homes can easily build up.\nCanada is one of several countries with high levels of radon.  Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and the Yukon are regions within the country that have radon levels that are comparable to some of the highest levels around the world, such as in the Czech Republic, Finland, Mexico and Sweden. However, every region in Canada has homes with elevated radon, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthwhile testing your home.  The percentage of homes with high radon levels are presented in the map below, developed by Colin Gutcher and the radon technical operations group at the Radiation Protection Bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThe percentage of homes with high radon levels in City of Ottawa Health Unit is 7%. In Canada, radon is the second highest cause of lung cancer, after smoking. November is Radon Action Month - there is no better time to start testing your home and ensuring that the air you breathe is safe for you and your family.\n\nThis map was created using data collected from the Cross-Canada Radon Survey (2011) and the Radon Thoron Survey in Canadian Metropolitan Areas (2013). Collected information is grouped by Health Region. Boundary files are sourced from Statistics Canada, 2018. Map produced by Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada, 2019. *A high radon level is defined as a radon level that is greater than the Health Canada guidelines for indoor radon, 200 Bq/m3.\n\nDownload the data (.csv)\n\n\nDownload the map (.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you find out the radon level in your home?\nSimple: test your home. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re located or what the levels are in your neighbours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 homes. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter whether your home is old or new, small or large.  While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that some communities have higher than average radon levels, each house is different and high radon levels can be found anywhere. If you do detect radon in your home, contact a certified radon professional to determine the most effective way to manage the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the benefit of removing radon from homes?\nThe big benefit is to help prevent lung cancer. More than 3,000 lung cancer deaths are attributable to radon in Canada each year, and removing radon from homes can reduce that number. Dr. Janet Gaskin, an epidemiologist at Health Canada, has conducted research to assess the risk from radon in homes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRadon mitigation is easy to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Gaskin. For example, installing radon preventive measures in new homes reduces radon entry. According to estimates, 453 fewer lung cancer deaths could be prevented every year in Canada if all new homes included radon reduction systems. If high levels of radon are measured in existing homes, a very effective technique called an active soil depressurization system can reduce radon by about 90%, and this would prevent even more lung cancer deaths every year.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately, lung cancer is still characterized by low survival rates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reminds Dr. Gaskin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cResearch suggests that radon prevention in new housing is very cost effective in every region of Canada and that testing and mitigation of high levels in existing housing is cost effective in higher radon regions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTesting your home for radon is easy to do and all homeowners are encouraged to test the radon level in their homes and to take action to reduce it if the level is high. After all, it could save lives!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2019-11-21\n\n\n\n"

Raising public awareness is a critical first step toward protecting Canadians from the health risks associated with long-term exposure to high radon levels. Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Radon Program (NRP) was established to educate the Canadian public, providing knowledge and resources to take action on radon. By increasing awareness, we can accelerate the reduction of radon in homes and other indoor spaces, reducing the risk of radon-induced lung cancer.    \n    \n\n\nAlthough Canadians are more aware of radon, there is still much work to be done. According to the Statistics Canada Household and Environment Survey, radon testing rates in Canadian households have only reached between 5% and 10% depending on the region. In addition, the 2015 Residential Radon Mitigation Actions Follow-Up study found that more than 70% of households with test results above the Canadian guideline of 200 Bq/m3 had not taken action to reduce their high radon level. Encouraging households nationwide to test and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if necessary \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reduce their radon exposure is a priority of the National Radon Program. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing awareness among Canadians\n\nIn 2020, the NRP decided to evaluate the impact of an outreach postcard, created to inform and encourage people to purchase a radon test kit. The goal was to answer two important questions: Does a behaviourally informed postcard increase awareness, and will this awareness translate to action?    \n    \n\n\nThe radon action postcard was designed to present a simple, direct message about the hazard of radon gas, and clear, action-oriented steps to provide a behavioural nudge to motivate purchasing a test kit and putting it to use. They were distributed to Canadian households in areas where more than 14.49% of homes tested above the Canadian guideline of 200 Bq/m3. Health Canada was then able to measure postcard impact, by tracking the number of test kits sold during the 8-week period, collecting data from the call centre, and monitoring website traffic.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we found\n\nThe study found that a targeted postcard does increase awareness, with a more substantial impact among communities with existing local radon awareness and engagement. Website visits to Canada.ca/radon from individuals living in targeted regions increased by over 4,000%, and TakeActiononRadon.ca saw an increase of more than 1,200%. Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call centre also saw a significant spike in calls compared to the same period the previous year.\n    \n\n\nWhile there was also an uptick in the number of test kits purchased, the impact was not comparable to the increase in web traffic. This study showed that the postcards do not adequately increase the behaviour of purchasing a radon test. Moving forward, these results demonstrate the need for further solutions that focus on the importance of testing. New strategies are required to motivate action.\n    \n\n\n    Click on the image to learn more about the postcard.    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\nBased on these findings, the NRP is proposing the addition of a coupon code, redeemable for a free radon test kit, to be included in future postcard mail outs. In combination with the postcards, ongoing awareness raising activities will help reinforce messaging and encourage action on this very important health issue.\n    \n\n\nTesting for radon is easy. Order your radon kit and start today.        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate modified: \n2020-11-26\n\n\n\n"

Learn more about reporting adverse events.\nReporting trends\n\nThe information on this page reflects detailed case information data from the Public Health Agency of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS) and Health Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canada Vigilance program. Doses administered used for reporting rate calculations have been adjusted to account for the delay between vaccination and reporting. The data on this page may undergo changes as more information about cases becomes available.\nThere have been a total of  reports (55.9 reports per 100,000 doses administered) up to and including . Of the  reports,  were considered serious (11.1 reports per 100,000 doses administered). Overall, the rate of serious reports has remained low. Figure 1 below shows the number and rate of COVID-19 adverse event reports by reporting period, as well as the cumulative number of reports.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n                    Choose a measure:\n\nQuarterly number\nQuarterly rate\nQuarterly number and rate\nCumulative number\nCumulative rate\nCumulative number and rate\n\n\nnumber\nrate\n\n                    of COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports received for \n                    \nall people\npeople 18 years and older\npeople 12 to 17 years\npeople 5 to 11 years\npeople 0 to 4 years\n \n                    and total doses administered per reporting period, up to and including MMM DD, 2021 (n=)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nQuarterly reporting rates are not provided after May 26, 2023, due to data quality issues introduced by the processing of a backlog of reports from jurisdictions.\nAs of December 3, 2023, some jurisdictions are only submitting data on doses administered for XBB.1.5 vaccines.\nA minimum 5-week reporting lag period is used to account for time lags between someone experiencing an adverse event since vaccine administration and the event being reported to CAEFISS or Canada Vigilance. To align the numerator and denominator for rate calculations, we restrict reports to those with a date vaccine administered as of December 3, 2023. This change is due to changes in the provincial and territorial reporting frequency of data on doses administered, and ongoing data improvement initiatives.\nAlthough the cumulative number of adverse event reports continues to increase over time, so does the number of doses administered. Up to and including MMM DD, 2021 all adverse event reports represented 0.056% of all doses administered.\nThe shaded area represents a period of time (lag time) where there may be delays in receiving and processing reporting forms. There may also be delays in receiving data on doses administered.\nInformation on doses administered by age group was only available starting April 23, 2021 for those aged 12 and older, starting November 27, 2021 for those aged 5 to 11 years, and starting July 17, 2022 for those under the age of 5.

For doses administered by vaccine type, please visit the vaccination coverage report.\nHigher rates of non-serious adverse event reports are observed for each vaccine. Serious report rates remain low. Currently, rates of adverse event reports following the first dose are higher than after subsequent doses.\nThe data for subsequent doses do not take into account which vaccine an individual received for previous doses. Generally, non-serious adverse event reports are consistent with information provided in the vaccine product pages.\nA total of 105,016,456 vaccine doses have been administered in Canada as of MMM DD, 2021, including 5,694,993 vaccine doses with the XBB.1.5 strain and 9,948,907 bivalent doses. Among all adverse event reports:\n                    \n1,044 were following bivalent vaccines, of which 783 were considered non-serious (0.008% of bivalent vaccine doses administered) and 261 (0.003% of bivalent vaccine doses administered) were considered serious.\n278 were following XBB.1.5 vaccines, of which 251 were considered non-serious (0.004% of XBB.1.5 vaccine doses administered) and 27 (0.0005% of XBB.1.5 vaccine doses administered) were considered serious.\n\n\n544 of the 58,712 COVID-19 adverse event reports (0.93%), involved people who received an influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine on the same day.

The reporting rate for females was 75.9 reports per 100,000 doses administered, compared to 31.5 per 100,000 doses administered for males. However, within the youngest age groups (<18 years of age) the reporting rate is similar in males and females, or slightly higher in males. \n                \nThis may be due to differences in health care seeking behaviour (for example, reporting adverse events) as well as biological differences between females and males.\n\nThe higher proportion and rate of adverse event reports for females has been observed in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and other countries.\n\nHealth Canada, PHAC, and provincial and territorial public health authorities will continue to monitor but have not identified this as a safety issue.\n\n\nFigure 3. \nNumber\nRate\n of adverse event reports received by \n            \nage group\nage group and sex\n\n            up to and including MMM DD, 2021 (n=)\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nAs of December 3, 2023, some jurisdictions are only submitting data on doses administered for XBB.1.5 vaccines.\nA minimum 5-week reporting lag period is used to account for time lags between someone experiencing an adverse event since vaccine administration and the event being reported to CAEFISS or Canada Vigilance.

They must be carefully monitored and confirmed by further special studies. AESI can be serious or non-serious and can include:\n\nevents of interest due to their association with COVID-19 infection.\nevents of interest for vaccines in general (e.g. to the specific vaccine type or adjuvants).\n\nThe list of AESIs below takes into consideration the lists of AESIs from these expert groups, manufacturers and regulatory authorities:\n\nBrighton Collaboration\nVaccine COVID-19 Monitoring Readiness protocol\n\nThe AESI list changes based on the evolving safety profile of vaccines. Although adverse events may occur after being vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, they are not necessarily related to the vaccine. Health Canada and PHAC review the reports to determine whether the vaccine may have played a role.\nUp to and including , the most commonly reported AESI was myocarditis/pericarditis (Table 1).\nTo align with standard reporting practices, for AESIs with a Brighton Collaboration case definition (BCCD), only those meeting the BCCD level of certainty 1 to 3 are reported.

While they are all highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19 illness and death, no vaccine is 100% effective, and some COVID-19 cases will still occur. For vaccines that have a two-dose regimen, protection begins 14 days after the first dose, and 7 to 14 days after the second dose.\n3 WHO guidance on pregnancy related AESIs.\n\nAn asterisk (*) indicates a vaccine product that is no longer authorized.\nAs of December 3, 2023, some jurisdictions are only submitting data on doses administered for XBB.1.5 vaccines.\nPlease note that 1 report represents 1 person and may contain information on more than 1 adverse event of special interest.\nA minimum 5-week reporting lag period is used to account for time lags between someone experiencing an adverse event since vaccine administration and the event being reported to CAEFISS or Canada Vigilance. To align the numerator and denominator for rate calculations, we restrict reports to those with a date vaccine administered as of June 18, 2023. This change is due to changes in the provincial and territorial reporting frequency of data on doses administered, and ongoing data improvement initiatives.\n\n\n\nSafety signals identified and other safety updates\nTo date, 2 safety signals have been confirmed: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) and myocarditis/pericarditis. This is based on adverse events that were reported in Canada during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which followed their detection internationally. These reports do not imply a causal relationship between the vaccines and the adverse event. Health Canada updated the respective product monographs to include information about these adverse events. Health Canada PHAC will continue to monitor these events.\n\n\nThrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome\nThrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is characterized as blood clotting with low platelet levels. Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), also known as Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), is characterized as TTS that seems to be vaccine-induced due to the laboratory-confirmed presence of platelet factor (PF) 4 antibodies.\n\t\t\t    \nNumbers and rates were adjusted following receipt of additional information by the Advisory Committee on Causality Assessment (ACCA).\nUp to and including June 25, 2021, 89 reports of TTS have been reported that met level 1 to 3 of the Brighton Collaboration level of diagnostic certainty. Of the TTS reports:\n\n56 reports followed vaccination with the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccine\n24 followed vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine\n8 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine.\nThe vaccine name for 1 was not specified.\n\nFor detailed information on the results of expert causality assessment for a subset of TTS reports, please visit the ACCA webpage.\n\n\n\nMyocarditis/pericarditis\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the lining around the heart.\nUp to and including June 25, 2021, there were 1,231 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis that met levels 1 to 3 of the Brighton Collaboration level of diagnostic certainty. Of the myocarditis/pericarditis reports:\n\n725 reports followed vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine\n465 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine\n18 followed vaccination with the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccine\n5 followed vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) bivalent vaccine\n4 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax (Original/Omicron BA.1) bivalent vaccine\n3 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax XBB.1.5 vaccine\n1 followed vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax (Original/Omicron BA.4/5) bivalent vaccine\n1 followed vaccination with the Janssen JCOVDEN vaccine\n1 followed vaccination with the Novavax Nuvaxovid vaccine\nthe vaccine name for 8 were not specified\n\nThe reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine is higher than that of the Pfizer BioNtech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine.\nAmong the 725 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine (administered to those 5 years of age and older):\n\nsymptoms started between 1 minute and 155 days after vaccination\nmedian age is 26 years (age range 6 to 88 years old)\n474 were males [median age 21 years (age range 7 to 86 years old)], 243 were females [median age 39 years (age range 6 to 88 years old)], the sex of 2 were 'other', and the sex of 6 were not specified\n286 reports followed the first vaccine dose, 392 reports followed the second vaccine dose, 41 reports followed the third vaccine dose, 5 reports followed the fourth dose, and the dose number for 1 was not specified\ncurrent analyses show the number of reports of myocarditis/pericarditis following the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine is higher than what would be expected in the general population of males and females less than 30 years old and primarily following the second dose\n\nAmong the 465 reports of myocarditis following vaccination with the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine (administered to those 6 months of age and older):\n\nsymptoms started between 5 minutes and 113 days after vaccination\nmedian age is 29 years (age range 14 to 95 years old)\n339 were males [median age 27 years (age range 14 to 95 years old)], 122 were females [median age 36 years (age range 18 to 88)], the sex of 1 was 'other', and the sex of 3 were not specified\n86 reports followed the first vaccine dose, 336 reports followed the second vaccine dose, 36 reports followed the third dose, 6 reports followed the fourth dose, and the dose number for 1 was not specified\ncurrent analyses show the number of reports of myocarditis/pericarditis following the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine is higher than what would be expected in the general population, particularly among males and females less than 40 years old and following the second dose\n\nEvidence is evolving and investigations into the association between myocarditis/pericarditis and mRNA vaccines continue.\n\n\n\nDeaths\n\nUp to and including June 25, 2021, a total of 488 reports with an outcome of death were reported following vaccination. Although these deaths occurred after being vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, they are not necessarily related to the vaccine. \nMedical case review previously used the WHO-UMC causality assessment categories to classify the status of death reports. Updated WHO guidance on causality assessment specific to vaccinations has been released. This updated user guide more accurately represents causality assessments following vaccination, so all reports with an outcome of death were updated and reclassified using the new classification system.\nOf the 488 death reports, it was not possible to assess causality for 131 reports due to missing information (not enough information to initiate causality assessment).\nPreliminary causality assessment was possible for the remaining 357 cases where there was sufficient information.

Activities that require very little movement, that involve sitting or reclining, are called sedentary behaviours.\nAmong children, common sedentary behaviours include sitting while watching TV, playing on the computer or iPad, or texting.  Excessive time spent being sedentary is linked to poor health in children and youth, no matter how active they are. More and more, evidence is suggesting that it is not just physical activity that impacts how healthy you are, but also what you do during down-time.\nEncouraging children and youth to give up even small amounts of screen-based activities each day in exchange for physical activities of any kind can make an important difference in their health and well-being.\nSedentary behaviour and physical activity are just two of the eight behavioural risk and protective factors included in the Chronic Disease and Injury Indicator Framework, which is updated annually.\n\n\n\n8.5 hours\nExcluding sleeping hours, Canadian youth (17 and under) spend on average 8.5 hours daily being sedentary. [PHAC]\n9.3 vs 7.6 hours\nAdolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 are more sedentary than children aged 5 to 11 by almost 2 hours daily. (9.3 versus 7.6 hours per day).

Subsequent data blogs will present near-real time eCHIRPP statistics on a variety of substances at regular intervals throughout 2020-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpioids\nContext: Between January 2016 and December 2019 there were more than 15,300 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada, and 72% of deaths involved one or more types of non-opioid substancesFootnote 1. Many fatal overdoses result from the illegal drug supply containing highly toxic synthetic opioids like fentanyl and fentanyl analogueFootnote 2. Between January 2016 and December 2019, 19,377 opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations occurred in Canada (excluding Quebec)Footnote 1. There is little evidence that the crisis is abating. More information on the actions taken by the Government of Canada to address the opioid crisis can be found under Federal Actions on Opioids-OverviewFootnote 3.\nWhat we know from a CHIRPP study Footnote 4 on opioids :\n        \nBetween March 2011 and June 2017, 583 suspected opioid-related poisoning/injury cases were identified in eCHIRPP.\nRecreational use of opioids was most common among adults.\nCompared to all types of injuries reported in the eCHIRPP database, opioid-related cases were more likely to:\n        \nbe among females\nbe self-harm\nhave occurred at home or in a residential institution\nhave occurred between 12:00 a.m. and 7:59 a.m.\nhave resulted in observation in the emergency room\nhave resulted in a hospital admission.\n\nThe most common factor contributing to opioid-related poisoning among young children (aged <5 years) was access to medication combined with lack of supervision (e.g. an unsupervised child found pills).\nSuicide attempt accounted for the largest proportion of cases in youth aged 10 to 19 years (33%), followed by older adults aged 50 years and older (28%) and adults aged 20 to 49 years (9%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethamphetamine\nContext: Use of methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant that can have harmful effects on the central nervous systemFootnote 5Footnote 6, is also an emerging public health issue alongside the opioids overdose crisis. There has been an increase in the availability, use and harms associated with methamphetamine use across Canada in the last 10 yearsFootnote 7.\nWhat we know from a CHIRPP studyFootnote 5on methamphetamine :\n        \nBetween April 1, 2011 and August 9, 2019, 1,093 patients (97.6 per 100,000 eCHIRPP cases) with methamphetamine-related injuries and poisonings were identified in eCHIRPP.\nOf these, 649 (59.4%) were male. Among those aged 10 to 14 and 15 to 19 years, females accounted for the majority of cases (71.4% and 63.7%, respectively). Of those aged 20 years and older, males accounted for 70.4% of cases.\nJust over a third of cases (n=404, 37%) involved methamphetamine use on its own. Of the 689 cases where additional substances were involved, 40.9% involved using two or more other substances with methamphetamine.\nWhen only one other substance was used with methamphetamine, the distribution was:\n        \n        \nalcohol (24.4%)\ncannabis (10.7%)\ncocaine (7.7%)\nheroin (5.4%)\nopiates (3.6%)\nother substances (e.g. LSD, ecstasy, psychoactive medications) (7.3%)\n\n\nAmong the 1,093 patients identified, there were a total of 1,389 injuries and poisonings (27.1% had multiple injuries).\n        \nMultiple injuries occurred more frequently in males (32.8% vs. 18.7% for females; p <.001)\nMore poisonings were seen in female patients (71% vs. 57.4% for males; p <.001)\nMultiple injuries were seen more frequently in male patients (32.8% vs. 18.7% for females; p <.001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCannabis\nContext: The prevalence of cannabis use has increased in Canada in recent decades, including since the legalization of non-medical cannabis use in 2018Footnote 8. Cannabis edible products and concentrates have been legal for sale in Canada as of October 17, 2019Footnote 9. Adverse health outcomes of cannabis use are known to include fatal and non-fatal injuries from motor vehicle collisions involving cannabis-related impairmentFootnote 10; acute ingestions among children causing altered levels of consciousness and other symptomsFootnote 11; and in adults, gastrointestinal ailments, intoxication and psychiatric symptoms, among othersFootnote 12. \nWhat we know from a CHIRPP studyFootnote 8 on cannabis:\n        \nBetween April 1, 2011 and August 9, 2019, there were 2,823 cannabis-related cases reported in eCHIRPP (252.3 cases per 100,000 eCHIRPP cases). Nearly two-thirds of these (63.1%) involved cannabis in combination with one or more other substances (polysubstance use). Approximately one-third of cases involved cannabis alone (31.3%), and cannabis edibles were reported among 5.6% of cases.\nCases ranged from 0 to 79 years of age. Children \u00e2\u0089\u00a417 years of age represented the majority (67.8%) of cannabis-related cases. \nFor all cannabis categories combined (cannabis alone, polysubstance use, and edibles), males represented a higher proportion of cases across all age groups with the exception of females aged 10 to 14 years, who were near equal to males at 50.3%.\nSignificant increases in annual percent change (APC) were identified in the study period. Overall, there was a 30.1% APC between 2015 and 2018.  A 27.9% annual percent change (APC) was noted among adults between 2013 and 2018, and among children there was a 35.6% APC between 2016 and 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-cigarettes and vaping substances\nContext: Vaping is the use of an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) or similar device to inhale vapour produced by heating vaping liquid or 'e-juice' which can contain nicotineFootnote 13Footnote 14 and/or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)Footnote 14. Research has also shown e-cigarettes are being used by some to deliver other substances such as methamphetamine and heroinFootnote 15Footnote 16. Prevalence of vaping has also been on the rise in Canada in recent years. It is more prevalent in youth than adults aged 25 and over, and prevalence among youth has increasedFootnote 17Footnote 18Footnote 19. One study reported the prevalence of vaping among adolescents aged 16 to 19 years, nearly doubled between 2017 and 2018Footnote 19. Since the emergence of electronic cigarettes on the Canadian market in 2018 there have been new injuriesFootnote 20. Children have been poisoned by ingesting vaping liquid as it is often flavouredFootnote 21Footnote 22Footnote  23, and packaging of e-liquids also look very similar to snacks for children, increasing their appealFootnote 24.There are also reports of vaping device malfunctions such as overheating batteries causing explosions and burnsFootnote 22. More recently, vaping-associated lung illness has emerged as a new public health threatFootnote 25.\nWhat we know from a CHIRPP studyFootnote 22 on e-cigarettes and vaping :\n        \nBetween April 1, 2011 and October 4, 2019, there were 68 cases of injury or poisoning related to e-cigarette use or vaping reported in eCHIRPP. Of these cases, 37 (54.4%) were males. \nJust over half of the cases (52.9%) were children under the age of five who either inhaled from the device or ingested the vaping liquid.\nTwo adults were injured/burned when the battery of their e-cigarette exploded in their pockets.\nThere were three reported traumatic brain injuries resulting from falls that occurred after vaping.\nMore than half of the cases (n=35, 51.5%) occurred in 2018 and 2019. Between 2013 and 2019, there was an annual percent change (APC) of 50.7% (95% CI: 15.9\u00e2\u0080\u009396.1).\n\n\n\n\nMore about the data source\nCHIRPP is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system currently operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and nine general hospitals across CanadaFootnote 26Footnote 27. It collects patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts of pre-event injury circumstances (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and clinical information is added to the data collection form by hospital staffFootnote 26Footnote 27. The CHIRPPcaptures a more complete picture of the injury event than hospital administrative or mortality data alone, and also identifies less serious injury cases that do not require hospitalizationFootnote 27.\nThe results from CHIRPP presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all substance use-related injuries and poisonings in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Teenagers older than 18 years of age, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously being entered into the eCHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data.\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nSpecial Advisory Committee on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses.

A concussion is a form of mild traumatic brain injury, and usually happens \r\nbecause of a hit to the head, neck, face or another part of the body, causing the brain to move inside the skull \r\nand become injuredFootnote 1. The short- and long-term consequences of concussion and other TBI can be severe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \r\nespecially for children and youth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although concussion signs and symptoms \r\nusually resolve within 10 days to four weeks, and children and youth often take longer to recover than adults Footnote 1.\n\n\n\nDive into the Data\n\n\n\nWhat do the graphs and tables show?\nThese tools are interactive snapshots of statistics about sports and recreation-related concussions and other TBIs among Canada's \r\nchildren and youth aged 5 to 19 years. The information is from the electronic database of the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) for the years 2011 to 2017.\nThe bar graph shows sports and recreation-related TBIs compared to all other injuries for your selected age group and sex. Use the \"Switch to\" button to toggle between the number of TBIs and the percentage of TBIs. Hover-over or tab to a specific sport/activity in the interactive bar graph to view more information.\nThe bee swarm graph shows the percentage (%) of concussions and other TBIs for your selected age group and sex, compared to all sports and recreation-related injuries among all age groups and both sexes combined, i.e. how your selection fits into the \"bigger picture\".\nUse the drop-down lists to change the graphs to look at:\n\nResults for specific age groups\nResults for males vs. females\n\nThe data tables show:\n\nThe data that were used to create the bar graph and bee swarm\nThe breakdown of all TBIs in two subcategories: concussions and non-concussion TBIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraumatic brain injuries compared to all injuries in a given sport among\n\n males\n females\n\naged \n\n 5 to 9\n 10 to 14\n 15 to 19\n\r\n        (eCHIRPP, 2011-2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTBIs account for 43.4%  of ice hockey incidents reported to eCHIRPP (or 630 injuries) among males aged 5 to 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to Percentages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData tables with concussion breakdown\nThe tables below contain all of the data in the beeswarm and bar graph. They also include a breakdown of all traumatic brain injuries in two subcategories: concussions and other TBI's.\n\nTable 1.

Number and percentage of sports and recreation-related concussions and other TBIs, females aged 15 to 19 years, eCHIRPP, 2011 to 2017\n\n\nResults Highlights\n\nOn average, concussions make up 93% of the sports and recreation-related TBIs among children and youth that are reported to CHIRPP.\nOverall, contact sports were the most common sports and recreation-related activities with reported concussions or other TBIs, for both sexes and in all age groups.\nIce hockey was the most common sports and recreation-related activity with reported concussions or other TBIs among males aged 5 to 14 years, but rugby was the most common for the older males.\nRingette was the most common sports and recreation-related activity with reported concussions or other TBIs among females aged 10 to 19. It is also worth noting that among females in all age groups shown, equestrian sport/horseback riding was also among the most common non-contact sport with reported concussions or other TBIs.\nSledding/tobogganing was among the most common sports and recreation-related activities with reported concussions or other TBIs for children aged 5 to 9 years (3rd most common after ice hockey and physical education class among boys, and 2nd after ice hockey among girls).\nAll-terrain vehicle (ATV) use was the leading cause of moderate to more severe TBIs** (i.e., showed the lowest percentage of concussions among all TBIs) among almost all children and youth, with the exception of females aged 5 to 9 (for whom it was equestrian sport/horseback riding, see Table 2,) and males ages 10 to 14 (for whom it was baseball, see Table 3).\n\nTake Note\nHow were these statistics calculated?\nThe percentage (% ) of concussions and other TBIs among all injuries for a given SPAR-related activity is calculated like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nNumber of concussions* and other TBIs** for a given sports and recreation-related activity\n\n\n\n\nNumber of all injuries for a given sports and recreation-related activity\n\n\n)\n\u00d7\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* The number of concussions includes both concussions and subconcussive impacts/undiagnosed concussion (minor closed head injury). In the eCHIRPP database, concussion is classified as Nature of Injury code 41 Minor closed head injury and 42 Concussion.\n** TBIs include subconcussive impacts, undiagnosed concussions, diagnosed concussions, other more serious intracranial injuries, as well as skull and facial fractures and crushing injuries. In the eCHIRPP database, TBI is classified as either Nature of Injury code 41 Minor head injury,  42 Concussion, or 43 Intracranial injury; in eCHIRPP TBI is also classified as follows: Body Part 110 Head including scalp, skull, or Body Part 120 Face,  combined with Nature of Injury code 12 Fracture, or Nature of Injury code 18 Crushing injury.\n\nLimitations\nThe results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all sports and recreation-related injuries in Canada.\r\n  CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Teenagers older than\r\n  18 years of age, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the eCHIRPP database,\r\n  as most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the\r\n  eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to\r\n  hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously being entered into\r\n  the eCHIRPP database; therefore some years do not yet have complete data.\nMore information and related material\n\nLearn more about concussions.\nLearn more about concussions in sport.\nLearn more about CHIRPP.\n\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nGovernment of Canada.

CNISP conducts prospective surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistant organisms (AROs) to inform evidence-based policies and control measures against antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\nCNISP collaborates with sentinel hospitals across the country to collect epidemiologic and microbiology data on HAIs and AROs. Over the years, CNISP has significantly expanded, and it now conducts surveillance on 12 different pathogens in 106 hospitals across 10 provinces and 1 territory. In addition to monitoring HAIs and AROs, CNISP also collects and analyzes data on antimicrobial use, infection prevention and control practices, laboratory practices, viral respiratory illnesses including COVID-19, and emerging threats such as Candida auris.\nAdditional information on CNISP can be found in our overview publication: The Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program: Keeping an eye on antimicrobial resistance in Canadian hospitals since 1995\nNEW Simplified Dataset (SDS)\nIn 2022, CNISP launched the Simplified Dataset (SDS), which allows hospitals outside of the CNISP network to contribute aggregate data to CNISP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rates. This project is currently being piloted with Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) with plans to expand to other HAIs and AROs. By combining patient-level data from participating CNISP hospitals and aggregate data from the SDS, CNISP will have a more representative sample of Canadian hospitals, enabling the program to report national and regional rates of AMR with greater accuracy. With almost 100 hospitals actively participating in SDS surveillance, CNISP is rapidly expanding its representativeness across Canada.\nCNISP is actively recruiting hospitals to participate in the SDS.

Within the less than 1 year age group, just under 20% of cases occurred among infants less than 6 months of age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat were the most common toy-related injuries?\nOverall, open wound injuries (23.5%) were the most frequent toy-related injury, followed by fractures (19.0%) and bruises/abrasions or soft tissue injuries (16.2%).  \nThe most frequent types of injuries varied by age group: \n\nLess than 1 year: Traumatic brain injuries at 29.1%, followed by foreign body injuriesFootnote ii at 16.0%.\n1 to 4 years: Open wounds at 32.3%, followed by foreign body injuries at 17.1%.\n5 to 17 years: Fractures at 28.7%, followed by bruises/abrasions or soft tissue injuries at 19.8%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the toy-related injuries happen?\nThe 4 most common mechanisms of toy-related injuries were:\n\nFalls, including tripping over toy (n = 17,272, 59.0%)\nStruck by/against objects (n = 6,249, 21.4%)\nForeign body entering into or through a natural orifice, including eye, ear, nose, and genitourinary tract (n = 2,012, 6.9%)\nIngestion or inhalation/aspiration of foreign body, except food (n = 1,736, 5.9%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of cases were admitted to hospital?\nHospital admission was required for 2.6% of toy-related injury cases (n = 773), of which the majority were hospitalized for fractures (55.0%). Other injuries requiring hospital admission included foreign body in the alimentary tract (11.8%), foreign body in the respiratory tract (6.7%) and traumatic brain injury (5.2%).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of injuries occurred from certain toys?\nInjuries related to children's wagons (n = 499) most frequently included traumatic brain injury (31.9%) and fracture (21.0%). The majority of the time (82.2%) these injuries were due to falls from the wagon.\nForeign body injuries were the most frequent nature of injury caused by  small toys or toy parts including marbles, building sets, modelling compounds, magnetic sets, board games, battery-operated toys and balloons. Examples of foreign body injuries include those of the alimentary tract, respiratory tract, nose, ear canal, external eye or genitourinary tract.\nOf the 1,418  riding toy-related injuries, open wound (29.5%) was the most frequent injury, followed by traumatic brain injury (21.4%) and fracture (17.8%). Riding-toy related injuries often occurred due to falling off the riding toy (85.1%).\nFracture (40.0%), bruises/abrasions or soft tissue injury (23.0%) and open wound (14.8%) represented the majority of all scooter-related injuries (n = 7,842). Falling (89.1%) while scootering was the most common mechanism of injury.\nThe majority of injuries related to toy weapons and projectile toys (n = 591) were eye injuries (36.7%) and open wounds (30.1%), largely from being struck by or against an object (81.9%).\nOpen wound (32.3%), traumatic brain injury (19.0%), and fracture (16.8%) were the most frequent  children's tricycle-related injuries (n = 607). These injuries often occurred from falling off the tricycle (79.7%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention and safety tips \nBelow are tips on ways to prevent toy-related injuries from occurringreference 1\n\nMake sure to choose age-appropriate toys. Toys for older children may contain small parts or present other hazards that make them unsafe for younger children. \nCheck that the toy is sturdy, well made and in good condition. \nMake sure to read toy instructions and ensure children are using toys how they were intended to be used. \nDo not give young children toys with small parts/accessories. \nDo not give children novelty magnet sets. \nMake sure that batteries are securely contained in the toy and that they are not accessible to the child. \nBe careful with button batteries, as they can result in significant injury or death if swallowed. \nMake sure any riding toys you buy are appropriate for your child's size, age and abilities. \n\n\n\n\nOnline resources\n\nFor more information on toy safety, please visit Toy safety tips - Canada.ca, Is Your Child Safe? Play Time\nFor more information on magnet safety, visit Magnet safety - Canada.ca \nFor more battery safety tips, visit Battery safety - Canada.ca \nFor the latest recalls on toys and other products, check  Find recalls, advisories and safety alerts - Canada.ca \n\n\nData limitations \nThe results presented above do not represent all toy-related injuries in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system that collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, M\u00c3\u00a9tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. \n\nReferences\n\n\n\nHealth Canada. Is Your Child Safe? Play Time [Internet].

The Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour, and Sleep (PASS) Indicators, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in 2017, track indicators that highlight these different components of daily activity. This framework reports on a range of indicators and measures focused on individual behaviours, the social environment and the built environment and gives an overall picture of \u00e2\u0080\u009chow active Canadians are\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The 2023 edition of the PASS Indicators provides access to 61 unique indicators among children/youth and adults, this information can be used to develop evidence-based policies and programs for a healthy and active Canadian population.\n\n\n\nPhysical activity\nCanadian adults ages 18 years and older should accumulate 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week to achieve optimum health benefits and protect against chronic diseases.Footnote 1 About half (49.2%) of Canadian adults get the recommended amount of physical activity each week.\nSimilarly, only 43.9% of Canadian children and youth get the recommended amount of physical activity per day. For optimal health benefits, Canadian children and youth ages 5 to 17 years should accumulate an average of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per day.Footnote 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSedentary behaviour\nOn average, Canadian adults spend 9.6 hours of their day sedentary, including 3.2 hours per day engaging in leisure screen time. Fewer than 1 in 5 (19.1%) Canadian adults meet current sedentary behaviour recommendations. To minimize poor health outcomes, adults should limit daily sedentary time to 8 hours or less per day with no more than 3 hours of leisure screen time.Footnote 1Activities that require very little movement, such as sitting or reclining, are called sedentary behaviours. Common sedentary behaviours include watching TV, sitting at a desk, or driving in an automobile. Research shows that sedentary behaviour is associated with an increased risk of chronic disease and other poor health outcomes.Footnote 3 \nCanadian children and youth spend approximately 8.4 hours of their day sedentary including 3.8 hours of leisure screen time. Only about half (53.3%) of Canadian children and youth meet current sedentary behaviour recommendations. To achieve optimal health and minimize negative health outcomes, children and youth should engage in no more than 2 hours per day of leisure screen time.Footnote 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep\nCanadian adults get an average of 8.0 hours of sleep per night and 72.7% meet current sleep recommendations. Canadian adults ages 18 to 64 years should obtain 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep on a regular basis and adults ages 65 years and older should obtain 7 to 8 hours of sleep on a regular basis.Footnote 1 Sleep supports healthy brain function and plays a vital role in good health and well-being. Insufficient sleep has been associated with various negative health outcomes, including chronic diseases, poor mental health and increased chance of death.Footnote 4 \nCanadian children and youth get an average of 9.0 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period and 70.7% meet current sleep recommendations. Canadian children ages 5 to 13 years should obtain 9 to 11 hours of sleep per night and youth ages 14 to 17 years should obtain 8 to 10 hours per night.Footnote 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24-Hour\nOnly 1 in 20 (5.9%) Canadian adults meet all three of the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep. Similarly, fewer than 1 in 10 (9.5%) children and youth meet all three recommendations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadians are active at home, at work and in their communities. Monitoring movement behaviours in specific environments gives us a clearer picture of what is going on.\nActive travel: In 2021, 2 in 5 (41.7%) Canadian adults and 3 in 5 (61.0%) youth report using active ways like walking or cycling to get to places such as work or school. Compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of youth engaging in active transportation has significantly declined by 14.7 percentage points (75.6% in 2018 vs. 60.9% in 2021). Using active modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, provides an important opportunity for Canadians to be active and increase their overall level of physical activity, while also improving cardiorespiratory fitness.Footnote 5\nSport participation and free play: Organized sport can provide important opportunities for children and youth to achieve physical activity. Physical activity can also be accumulated through unstructured free play during leisure time. About half of children and youth (54.4%) participated in organized sports with a coach or instructor in the past week and reported an average of 2.8 hours of organized sport per week. Two thirds of children (68.1%) reported 3 hours or less per week of unstructured free play outside of school and youth reported an average of 2.4 hours per week participating in outdoor physical activity during their free time. Regularly participating in sports (organized or free play) is associated with higher levels of physical activity, lower levels of sedentary behaviour and overall better mental health outcomes in children and youth.Footnote 6Footnote 7\nUse of electronic media in the bedroom: About 2 in 3 (65.4%) Canadian adults report having an electronic device such as a cellphone, television or computer in their bedroom while sleeping and 66.4% report using electronic devices within 30 minutes of falling asleep. Over 2 in 5 (45.3%) Canadian children and youth report using electronic devices in the bedroom before falling asleep. Using electronic devices before bedtime can increase cognitive activity and make it difficult to relax and fall asleep, this can lead to poor sleep quality.Footnote 8Footnote 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PASS Indicators recognize that some broader factors, like family relationships and societal norms, as well as how communities are built (for example, bike lanes and access to parks), all have an impact on a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daily activities.\nPhysical activity and the family/social environment: About 1 in 3 (35.4%) Canadian youth report that they do physical activity with their parents at least weekly and about half (57.5%) report that their close friends are involved in physical activity on a regular basis. Parental and peer support, including role modelling, material support and encouragement have been associated with greater participation, enjoyment, and confidence in physical activity among youth.Footnote 10Footnote 11Footnote 12Footnote 13 \nAccess to parks and recreational facilities: The majority of Canadians (87.4% of adults and 90.0% of youth) report that their neighbourhood has several free or low-cost recreational facilities such as parks, walking trails, bike paths, recreation centers, playgrounds, or public swimming pools. Having accessible facilities (in terms of location and cost) helps increase the physical activity of Canadians.\n\n\n\nFor an overview of all the healthy living indicators reported on in the PASS Indicators see the PASS Quick Stats page. To view additional indicators and each indicator by sociodemographic characteristics such as sex, age group, education, household income, cultural/racial background, Indigenous identity, and immigrant status please visit the PASS Data Tool page.\nThe PASS Indicators are intended to support a comprehensive surveillance of movement behaviours in Canada. In addition to the indicators currently in the PASS framework, new indicators will be released as appropriate measures and data sources are identified, such as physical literacy, presence and types of barriers for physical activity, community walkability, workplace sedentary time, awareness about sleep benefits and several more. Adapting existing data sources or developing new sources of information and measurement tools will be important to fill current data gaps and improve our reporting.\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nRoss R, Chaput JP, Giangregorio LM, Janssen I, Saunders TJ, Kho ME, et al.

Published:   (2017-05-11)\nAn indicator framework answers the call for easily digestible data. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one to peruse scientific data, you may already know what an indicator framework is. For those who are new to the concept, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s break it down.\n\nAn indicator is a single data element \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a snapshot of the state, level or measure of something. \nA framework is simply the structure of \u00e2\u0080\u009ca system, concept, or text\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nAn indicator framework is an organized way to view data from different sources. It is a simple and concise way to present gathered data and help show the relevance and connection between   different indicators. In a framework, data can be grouped or categorized and are often shown alongside detailed descriptions of associated measures and methods of calculation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Anatomy of an Indicator Framework\n\n\n\n\nData Category\nData Group\nMeasure\nSingle Data Element\nDifferent Sources\n\n\n\n\nSocial and Environmental Determinants\nEducation\n% of population with less than a high school education, population aged 20+ years.\n12.8%\nCCHS (2014)\n\n\nIncome\n% of population living below low-income cut-offs, after tax, total population.\n9.7%\nCIS (2013)\n\n\nEmployment\nAverage annual unemployment rate (% of labour force that was unemployed during reference period), population aged 15+ years.\n6.8%\nLFS (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does this help make scientific data more easily accessible?\nAn indicator framework can be tailored to showcase the most important data from a report. Instead of skimming through 50+ pages for the three statistics you need, you can view them all on one page, and even compare them with others that you may not have considered.\nThere you have it! All the data you need - bite sized.\n\n\n\nSo what do indicator frameworks look like anyway? Here are some cool examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Chronic Disease Indicators\nThe Canadian Chronic Disease Indicators (CCDI) is a comprehensive pan-Canadian resource on the burden of chronic diseases, injuries and associated determinants.

Published: (2018-06-28)\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) reports on a range of indicators related to Canadians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep habits. These indicators are organized in a framework called the  Physical Activity, Sedentary behaviour and Sleep (PASS) Indicator Framework. The information provided by the PASS Indicator Framework will inform programs and policy to improve the health of Canadians. \n\n\n\nWhat is sedentary behaviour?\nSedentary behaviour refers to activities that we do while we are sitting, reclining or lying down and expending very little energy.  Some examples include watching television, using a computer or tablet, and sitting in a bus, car or train.  Experts in the field recently defined sedentary behaviour and all of its associated caveats.Footnote\u00a01 It is important to note that sedentary behaviour is not simply the absence of physical activity but has been shown to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even if you exercise! Footnote\u00a02 Canadians spend the majority of their time being sedentary, in fact the average Canadian child/youth and adult spends 8.4 and 9.6 hours per day engaged in sedentary behaviour, respectively. Footnote\u00a03 Replacing sedentary time with even light physical activity can have health benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is measuring sedentary behaviour important?\nBecause greater sedentary behaviour is recognized as a risk factor for many chronic diseases, population health organizations such as PHAC, track it for surveillance purposes. Footnote\u00a04 Tracking helps to assess this behaviour in the Canadian population over time, identify whether one segment of the population is more sedentary than another (e.g., adults vs. children) and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on reducing sedentary time.  For example, surveillance work has identified that only 28.5% of Canadian children and youth report meeting the new sedentary behaviour component of the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, by spending 2 hours or less per day watching television or using a computer during leisure time.Footnote\u00a03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is sedentary behaviour measured?\nNew technologies provide the ability to objectively measure how much sedentary time an individual gets using research accelerometers which continuously track movement and intensity.  The Canadian Health Measures Survey currently uses these types of devices.  While these devices provide more precise estimates of sedentary behaviour over an entire day, they can be costly and require more time for both the survey respondents who must wear and return them and for those who analyze the data.  In addition, these devices cannot easily provide information around the types of sedentary behaviour a person engages in.  They can, however, be used to interpret reporting error in self-reported measures. Due to these limitations, population health surveillance strategies often rely on self-report measures of sedentary behaviour using questionnaires.  These questionnaire tools offer more flexibility in terms of identifying time spent in different types of sedentary behaviour and their affordability allows for their inclusion on large scale surveys which collect data on subpopulations (such as all provinces and territories in Canada).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the measurement of sedentary behaviour changing?\nWith the arrival of smartphones, tablets, and newer technologies, how and why Canadians engage in sedentary behaviour has greatly changed, and is continuing to change.  Historically, Canadians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sedentary behaviour habits were largely assessed by asking individuals how much leisure time they spent watching television, on the computer, playing video games or reading (starting with the Canadian Community Health Survey in 2000-01).  While these are some of the main types of sedentary behaviour, there are now several others.  Many Canadians now spend a lot of time sitting while commuting in a car, bus or train, and many are using other technologies such as tablets and smartphones and multitask between devices.  For example, you might be watching TV, but also reading email on your smartphone.  Special care must be taken in surveys to avoid over counting sedentary time in these situations.\nWith newer technologies and greater reliance on motorized transport, PHAC developed the PASS Indicator Framework as an effort to stay current with changing behaviours in the population in their surveillance strategies. This includes efforts to update questions for use on large, national population health surveys. PHAC partnered with Canadian researchers to design a new self-report tool to measure sedentary behaviour in the Canadian population. The tool is based on best practices from international surveys and the literature for self-report measurement of sedentary behaviour. The series of questions; now referred to as the International Sedentary Assessment Tool (ISAT), was recently published.Footnote\u00a05 It is available for use in future surveys or other questionnaires and can be downloaded in Word format.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n Footnote 1 \n\nSedentary Behaviour Research Network. 2017.

Published: (2019-01-22)\n The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) actively monitors rare and/or emerging diseases and conditions in children and youth. It examines conditions that are high-risk in terms of disability and economic costs to society, despite their low frequency.\nSince 1996, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Society have maintained CPSP with the voluntary contribution of over 2700 paediatricians and other doctors who provide specialized care for children and youth.\nOver 75 surveillance studies and over 50 one-time surveys have been completed, covering a diverse range of topics including:\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis (monitoring for polio)\nHealth hazards related to the consumption of energy drinks\nCongenital Zika syndrome\nChildhood Lyme disease\nInjuries related to liquid detergent packets\nAdverse drug reactions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 serious and life threatening\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder\nSevere alcohol intoxication in adolescents\nCannabis for medical purposes\nVaccine hesitancy\nType 2 diabetes\nVitamin D deficiency rickets\nTuberculosis\n\nAll of CPSP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concluded studies and current studies are available online.\n\nHow does CPSP surveillance work?\nEach month, participating doctors receive an initial report form from the CPSP listing the conditions currently under surveillance.  They are asked to indicate the number of new cases they have seen in that month.\nFor each case reported, the CPSP mails out a detailed case report form for the doctor to complete.  Note that the patient remains anonymous as no directly identifying information is included (e.g., child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, health insurance number). Detailed case reports are returned to the program where a team of investigators analyzes the data and reports on findings:\n\nDetectionThe CPSP gathers data from up to 2700 paediatricians and other doctors who provide specialized care for children and youth across Canada each month to monitor conditions of interest.CPSP gathers only anonymized data already captured in patient charts.\nDeductionTeams of CPSP investigators analyze and interpret the data in order to better understand how to prevent or control the conditions.\nDisseminationStudy results are published by the CPSP and other sources and are acted upon to improve the health of children and youth in Canada.\n\nAn average of 10 CPSP surveillance studies are underway at any given time.\nThere are three types of studies: ongoing studies, time-limited studies, and one-time surveys.\nThe two ongoing surveillance studies include: \n\nSurveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (monitoring for polio) - since 1996.\nReporting of severe and life-threatening adverse drug reactions - since 2004.\n\nTime-limited studies are conducted for a defined period of time, typically 2 years, though they can be extended or repeated.\nAs not all national surveillance questions warrant a complete study, the CPSP conducts one-time surveys to help capture a signal, or answer a specific emerging public health concern. Three new one-time surveys are launched each year.\nAll CPSP study protocols and forms are available on the CPSP website.\n\n\n\n\nHow are diseases and conditions identified for surveillance?\nAn application to start a CPSP surveillance study or one-time survey can be submitted at any time by investigators.  The CPSP office works with the investigators to refine the application and seek approval from the CPSP Steering Committee. For more information about the application process and the criteria for selection, visit the CPSP application webpage.\nHow are CPSP Results reported and used?\nCPSP study results are published in:\n\nannual reports\nmedical journals\nCPSP Highlights published in Paediatrics and Child Health\nCPS News \nat conferences and more!\n\nResults can be useful to researchers, policy, program and support professionals, health care professionals, patients and families and others seeking to improve the health of children and youth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some examples of CPSP study results making a difference in the lives of Canadians?\nCPSP Surveillance studies and one-time surveys have informed:\n\nPublic health policies and legislation\n\nThe total ban on the sale of baby walkers in Canada and the legislation requiring booster seats in cars to prevent seat-belt syndrome.\n\nProfessional medical guidelines\n\nGuidelines such as the practice point on Zika virus, and position statement on medical assistance in dying.\n\nPublic health promotion and education\n\nEfforts to prevent vitamin D deficiency rickets and to prevent the use of e-cigarettes in those under the legal age to use conventional tobacco products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the CPSP work with other countries?\nDiseases can cross borders and surveillance systems are more nimble and effective when techniques and results are shared. The CPSP actively collaborates with 12 other paediatric surveillance units\r\nworldwide through the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INOPSU).\nDo you have questions or want to know more?\nVisit the CPSP website and/or contact the CPSP.\n\n\n\n\nPlease take a few minutes to anonymously tell us about your experience with this data blog.

In 2019, \n                suicide was the ninth leading cause of death in Canada. However, \n                it was the second leading cause of death among people aged 15 to \n                34.\nIn Canada, the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention aims to:\n\nreduce stigma and raise public awareness\nconnect people in Canada with information and resources\naccelerate the use of research and innovation in suicide prevention\n\nTo support this, the Public Health Agency of Canada developed \n                the Suicide Surveillance Indicator Framework. This interactive \n                data tool shows statistics on suicide and self-harm and their risk \n                and protective factors.\nThis data blog complements the framework by providing more \n                information to stakeholders and the public.

This prevents accidental overdoses and reduces the spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV.\nSince January 2017, every federally exempted SCS in Canada regularly reports its data to Health Canada, and that data is summarized in this dashboard. However, prior to March 2020,  there was no standardized reporting format. Because of this, we separate the dashboard into 2 sections. The first section is a general summary of data for all SCS operating at any point between January 2017 and {Date2}. The second section provides detailed information for all SCS operating at any point between March 2020 and {Date2}.\nGeneral summary: January 2017 to {Date2}\nOverall, results from data reported to Health Canada during this period indicate that there were:\n\n\n\n\n{}\nTotal visits\n\n\n\n\n{}\nUnique clients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{}\nNon-fatal overdoses\n\n\n\n\n{}\nTotal referrals\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed information: March 2020 to {Date2}\nMap of supervised consumption sites\nEach SCS is represented by a black dot on the map.

This risk can be attributed to a number of factors, which can include decreased mobility and balance, muscle weakness and visual impairment among individuals.Footnote 1 Fall-related injuries among older adults can have serious health and social consequences, impacting the quality of lives and even causing deaths.\nIn Canada, as the population ages and life expectancy increases, mortality rates associated with falls have increased by 111% between 2001 and 2019 among adults aged 65 years and older. Similarly, the number of fall-related hospitalizations in Canada among this population rose by 47% from 2008 to 2019Footnote * (this estimate excludes Quebec).Footnote 2 In 2018, it was estimated that the direct cost of fall-related injuries among Canadian adults aged 65 years and older was approximately $5.6 billion, a cost doubling that among those in the 25 to 64 years age groupFootnote3.\nAs adults aged 65 years and older are expected to represent over a fifth of the Canadian population by 2068Footnote 4, continuing to monitor fall-related injuries and deaths among this population and examining associated risk factors will be important measures that can help guide and inform prevention efforts. In this light, the Public Health Agency of Canada released a comprehensive report in 2022 presenting national-level health statistics on falls among adults aged 65 years and older using a variety of health data sources. This data blog builds on this report in that it provides the most recent national-level statistics on fall-related deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits among older adults in Canada. Information on factors contributing to falls is also provided to help inform prevention efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaths due to falls\nFigure 1 presents numbers on deaths and mortality rates due to falls by age and sex. In 2021, 6,579 adults aged 65 years and older died of falls in Canada (this estimate excludes Yukon). As shown, mortality rates generally rose with age among both men and women. In each age group, men had higher mortality rates compared to women, yet women had a higher overall rate (95.9 per 100,000 vs 89.5 per 100,000). In total, more women died from falls (n =3,657) compared to men (n = 2,922), a finding reflecting the fact that there are more women than men aged 65 years and older in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Figure 1: Number of fall-related deaths and mortality rates, by age and sex, population aged 65 years and older, Canada (Yukon not included), 2021\n                                \n\n\n\n\nAge group (years)\nCount (Men)\nCount (Women)\nRate per 100,000 (Men)\nRate per 100,000 (Women)\n\n\n\n\n65 to 69\n174\n83\n16.1\n7.2\n\n\n70 to 74\n297\n174\n33.6\n18.0\n\n\n75 to 79\n324\n303\n54.0\n44.5\n\n\n80 to 84\n518\n510\n138.7\n108.9\n\n\n85 to 89\n724\n855\n338.8\n274.2\n\n\n90+\n885\n1,732\n800.9\n733.9\n\n\nAll 65+\n2,922\n3,657\n89.5\n95.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFall-related hospitalizations\nFigure 2 presents numbers on fall-related hospitalizations and rates by age and sex. In 2022Footnote *, there were 78,076 fall-related hospitalizations (this estimate excludes Quebec) among adults aged 65 years and older, representing 88.6% of all injury-related hospitalizations among this age group. Of these falls, women accounted for nearly two-thirds of such hospitalizations (n = 49,919). For both men and women, hospitalization rates increased with age, yet those among women were consistently higher compared to men. Over a third (34.4%) of fall-related hospitalizations (n = 26,848) among adults aged 65 years and older were associated with a hip fracture.

In 2022Footnote *, there were 200,825 fall-related ED visits reported in Ontario and Alberta among adults aged 65 years and older. Of these ED visits, nearly two-thirds were among (n = 126,765) women. Similar to hospitalizations, ED rates increased with age for both men and women, and those among women were consistently higher compared to men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFigure 3: Number of fall-related emergency department visits and rates by age and sex, population aged 65 years and older, Ontario and Alberta, 2022Footnote *\n\n\n\n\n\nAge group (years)\nCount (Men)\nCount (Women)\nRate per 1,000 (Men)\nRate per 1,000 (Women)\n\n\n\n\n65 to 69\n13,998\n21,657\n26.5\n37.9\n\n\n70 to 74\n13,653\n21,586\n32.9\n46.4\n\n\n75 to 79\n13,499\n21,768\n44.7\n61.9\n\n\n80 to 84\n12,231\n20,608\n65.8\n87.1\n\n\n85 to 89\n11,469\n19,783\n109.1\n129.5\n\n\n90+\n9,210\n21,363\n165.0\n187.2\n\n\nAll 65+\n74,060\n126,765\n46.5\n67.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors contributing to falls among older adults\nAs presented in Table 1, there are many risk factors associated with falls, some of which stem from biological, behavioural, social/economic and environmental factors. Fall prevention efforts generally entail a multifaceted approach, consisting of a number of key strategies. At the individual level, for instance, participating in balance and strength exercises, obtaining proper sleep, eating well and staying hydrated are strategies that may reduce the risk of falls among older adults. At the community level, providing educational opportunities to older adults on fall prevention strategies (i.e knowledge of medical equipment, exercise programs and fall prevention skills), installing handrails and grab bars, and removing debris such as snow and ice from public walkways are examples of broader scale approaches.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a natural phenomenon that occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve over time to resist the effects of antimicrobials used to treat or prevent infections. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics is a well-known factor for accelerating the rates of AMR.\nThe Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) integrates and synthesizes information from various surveillance systems and laboratory reference services covering humans, animals, and food to present data on AMR and antimicrobial use (AMU) in the human (hospital and community) and animal settings.\nKey Findings\n\nHuman antimicrobial use continues to decrease, however inappropriate prescribing is common.\n                        \nBetween 2017 and 2022, antimicrobial consumption in the healthcare sector decreased across all Canadian jurisdictions and the annual number of prescriptions filled by retail pharmacies in the community and the total number of prescriptions decreased.\nFrom 2019 to 2022, there was a decrease in the average monthly prescription rate in the community sector, with the greatest decrease during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 to May 2021).\nFrom 2018 to 2022, nearly one-fifth of prescriptions were deemed inappropriate or suboptimal in participating Canadian healthcare facilities.\n\n\nAntimicrobials sold for use in animals decreased, however farm-level antimicrobial use increased in some sectors.\n                        \nBetween 2020 and 2021, the quantity of medically important antimicrobials sold for use in all animals in Canada decreased.\nThe quantity of antimicrobials used on sentinel farms increased for broiler chickens and grower-finisher pigs (across all AMU measures), increased for turkeys in kgs and remained stable in mg/PCU.\n\n\nIn 2021, when compared to the 30 European countries reporting to ESAC-Net for total consumption (combining use in healthcare and community sectors), Canada was the tenth lowest consumer or antimicrobials per capita. In the animal sector, ESVAC Network data ranked Canada the seventh highest consumer in terms of quantities (mg/PCU) of antimicrobials sold for use in production animals (including horses) compared to European countries.\n\n\n\nNotes\nSource: IQVIA and Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS)\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2021, the average quantity (in kg) of antimicrobials sold for use in animals was almost 4.1 times the amount consumed in humans for the nine most reported antimicrobial classes.\n                        \nPenicillins were the most consumed antibiotics by humans (annual average of 113,168.1 kg), whereas tetracyclines were the antimicrobial class with the highest quantity (in kg) sold for use in animals (annual average of 525,888.3 kg).\nIn 2021, the tonnage of tetracyclines sold for use in animals was 66.7 times the amount consumed by humans.\n\n\nIn 2021, the top three antimicrobials used in humans were penicillins (89,376.5 kg), first and second generation cephalosporins (36,771.3 kg) and sulfamethoxazole (18,079.6 kg).\nIn 2021, the top three antimicrobials with the highest amounts sold for use in animals were tetracyclines (517,908 kg), penicillins (129,711 kg), and macrolides (102,667 kg).\n\nSetting\n\nHealthcare\n                        \nHuman Antimicrobial Use in the Healthcare Sector\nNational Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey\n\n\n\n\nCommunity\n                        \nHuman Antimicrobial Use in the Community\nHuman Antimicrobial Use in the Community before and during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\n                        \nAntimicrobials sold for use in animals\nFarm-level surveillance of AMU and AMR\n\n\n\nComparison of antimicrobial consumption in humans and antimicrobials sold for use in animals in Canada and European countries in 2021\n\nIn 2021, Canada was the tenth lowest consumer of antimicrobials per capita compared to the 30 European countries reporting to ESAC-Net for the total consumption (combining antimicrobial use in healthcare and community sectors), whereas ESVAC Network data ranked Canada the seventh highest consumer in terms of quantities (mg/PCU) of antimicrobials sold for use in production animals (including horses) compared to European countries.\nHuman AMU data shows that Canada consumed nearly 50.0% more antimicrobials than Germany (the country with the lowest consumption) and nearly half of the amount consumed by Romania (the country with the highest consumption).\nAnimal AMU data shows that the quantity sold for use in production animals (mg/PCU) was three times higher than the median of the European countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nHuman AMU data are ordered from lowest to highest, and animal AMU data were included based on this order.\nData in the figure above represent totals in human consumption, data in healthcare and community sectors combined where applicable; data for Germany and Iceland are only data from the community sector, data from the healthcare sector were not reported in the ESAC-Net data by these two countries.\nThe metric used for Canada is mg/PCUCA (Canadian weights)\nSource: IQVIA, ESAC-Net, Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) & ESVAC Network \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIPARS Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\nCIPARS AMR interactive data visualizations provide an overview of AMR data, including temporal trends in susceptibility, resistance, and multiclass resistance among bacteria isolated from various host species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMpox (monkeypox) epidemiology update\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is working with health authorities in the provinces and territories to investigate cases of mpox in Canada.\n\n\n\nAll Health Infobase data products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find what you were looking for?\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nIf not, tell us why:\n\n\nWhat was wrong?\n\n\n The answer I need is missing\n                                                \n\n\n\n The information isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear\n                                                \n\n\n\n I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the right place\n                                                \n\n\n\n Something is broken or incorrect\n                                                \n\n\n\n Other reason\n                                                \n\n\nPlease provide more details\n\n(Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include any personal information.

However, most don't know about the cancer risks at low consumption levels\nOver one-third are not familiar with the concept of a \"standard drink\". Among those who are, many struggle to put the concept into practice when beverages don't come in a single-serving container\nMost people agree that the labels on alcohol products should display or provide:\n                            \nthe number of standard drinks (62%)\nguidance to reduce health risks (60%)\nhealth warnings (55%)\n\n\nMore than half (59%) believe that alcohol should not be exempt from the health information labels required for other regulated products, such as tobacco and cannabis\nMost believe that such health labelling of alcohol products would help them:\n                            \ntrack their alcohol consumption\nthink more readily about alcohol-related harms\nthink about cutting back on drinking or talking to others about cutting back\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nIn Canada, alcohol is a legal and socially accepted psychoactive substance. However, the latest scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that any amount of alcohol poses health risksFootnote 1. Alcohol is linked to numerous health conditions, including 7 types of cancer and liver diseaseFootnote 2.\nTo better understand awareness of alcohol-related harms, Health Canada developed and implemented the Public Awareness of Alcohol-related Harms Survey (PAAHS). The PAAHS assesses the public's knowledge and opinions about:\n\neducational campaigns about alcohol\nnational drinking guidelines\nstandard drink measurements\nawareness of alcohol-related health risks\nhealth labelling of alcohol products\n\n\nAbout the sample\nSurvey recipients were randomly recruited from all provinces and territories in Canada. There were 9,812 participants aged 16 years and older surveyed between February 13 and June 30, 2023. The results are weighted to match population proportions based on region, age and sex. The overall sample includes both consumers and non-consumers of alcohol. However, some survey questions were directed only to those who had previously consumed alcohol, as noted throughout the text below. A small subset of respondents (n=435) who had never consumed alcohol was excluded from those analyses that specifically focused on current and former consumers (see Definitions).\nPAAHS results are organized by theme. Within each theme, factors such as age, alcohol consumption status, and sex or gender are considered. \nFor more details about the sample and the analysis, please refer to the Survey notes. Details about the survey methodology from the archived report are available on the Library and Archives Canada website.\n\nKey findings by theme\nAwareness of alcohol education campaigns and messages\nAll respondents were asked about their awareness of recent educational campaigns and public health messages about alcohol risks and safer drinking practices.\nOverall, 81% of people said they had noticed alcohol-related messaging in the past 12 months, while 19% had not noticed any. There were no meaningful differences by gender, age, or alcohol consumption status. Common sources of messaging (see Figure 1) included:\n\nTV or radio (59%)\nprint newspapers or magazines (25%)\nsocial media (25%)\n\n\nAdditional information on the awareness of education campaigns is available in the archived report.\n\nFigure 1. Sources of alcohol messaging in the past 12 months, by Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n#: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed\nSource: PAAHS 2023\n\n\n\n\nAwareness of alcohol drinking guidelines\nAll respondents were asked about their awareness of \"Canada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines\" (LRDG) or \"Canada's Guidance on Alcohol and Health\" (CGAH) (see Survey notes). The survey also asked people where they had first encountered alcohol drinking guidelines.\nOverall, 59% of people were aware of the LRDG or CGAH (Figure 2). They most commonly reported hearing of them through:\n\nTV or radio (61%)\nprint newspapers or magazines (12%)\nsocial media (8%)\n\nAwareness of the guidelines was lowest among youth (40% of 16 to 19 year olds) and increased with age. Guideline awareness was also lower among former consumers of alcohol (50%). There was no meaningful difference by gender.\n\nFigure 2. Awareness of alcohol drinking guidelines, by Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023 \n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n#: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed\nSource: PAAHS 2023\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge of standard drink measurements\nPeople who had never consumed alcohol (excluding occasional sips for religious or other purposes), did not participate in this section of the survey and are not included in this analysis.\nFirst, respondents identified their typical alcoholic beverage of choice. Then, if they were familiar with the term \"standard drink\", they were shown an image of this beverage (Figure 3) and asked to determine the number of standard drinks in the container. The image displayed the container's volume and the beverage's percentage of alcohol by volume.\n\nFigure 3. Images of alcohol containers shown to respondents to determine number of standard drinks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText description\nAlcohol containers displayed from left to right:\n\nBeer, 341 ml (12 oz), 5% alcohol by volume\nSpirits, 750 ml (25 oz), 40% alcohol by volume\nWine, 750 ml (25 oz), 12% alcohol by volume\nCider/cooler, 341 ml (12 oz), 5% alcohol by volume\n\n\n\nTypical alcoholic beverage: When asked which alcoholic beverage they typically consumed, people replied:\n\nwine (43%)\nbeer (28%)\nspirits (22%)\ncider or coolers (7%)\n\n\nWine was most popular among women (56%), while men favored beer (41%).\nBy age, younger people (16 to 19 years old and 20 to 24 years old) preferred beer and spirits, while older people (25 to 49 years old and those aged 50 years and older) preferred wine and beer.\nBy alcohol consumption status, consumers preferred wine and beer, while former consumers preferred wine and spirits.\nFamiliarity with \"standard drink\": 61% of people who had ever consumed alcohol were familiar with the term \"standard drink\". There were no meaningful differences by age or gender. Consumers (62%) were more familiar with the term than former consumers (48%).\nPutting standard drinks into practice: Overall, 70% of those familiar with the term \"standard drink\" incorrectly determined the number of standard drinks in the image of their typical alcoholic beverage. This is despite being provided with the information necessary to calculate the answer. More results by specific beverage type are provided below. People familiar with the term \"standard drink\" were more accurate when their typical beverage came pre-portioned in a single-serving container, such as beer, cider or coolers. \n\nBeer: Among those shown the bottle of beer, 89% correctly determined that it contained 1.0 standard drink. Six percent (6%) of people estimated that it contained 2.0 standard drinks. The average response was 1.2 standard drinks, while the median was 1.0. Most people answered correctly, but for those who got it wrong, the tendency was to overestimate\nSpirits: Among those shown the bottle of spirits, 30% underestimated the number of standard drinks, and almost all (99%) failed to determine that it contained 17.6 standard drinks. Nearly half (48%) of people estimated 25.0 standard drinks. The average response was 22.1 standard drinks, while the median was 25.0\nWine: Among those shown the bottle of wine, 58% underestimated the number of standard drinks, and almost all (99%) failed to determine that it contained 5.3 standard drinks. Most people were relatively close; common responses were 5.0 standard drinks (38%), 6.0 standard drinks (25%), and 4.0 standard drinks (16%). The average response was 6.3 standard drinks, while the median was 5.0\nCider/coolers: Among those shown the can of cider or cooler, 61% correctly determined that it contained 1.0 standard drink. A quarter (25%) of people estimated 2.0 standard drinks. The average response was 1.5 standard drinks, while the median was 1.0. This indicates most people answered correctly but for those who got it wrong, the tendency was to overestimate\n\nDue to small sample sizes, these results are not reported by gender, age or alcohol consumption status.\n\nPerceptions of alcohol-related health risks\nAll respondents were asked about their perceptions of the impacts of different levels of alcohol consumption on their risk of 11 specific health conditions (Figure 4):\n\narthritis\ndiabetes\nliver disease\ncolon cancer\nmouth cancer\nthroat cancer\nheart disease\nbreast cancer\nhigh cholesterol\nbeing overweight or obese\nharm to a fetus during pregnancy\n\nAlcohol is known to increase the risk of all these health conditions except arthritis. Its effect on diabetes is complexFootnote 3.\n\nFigure 4. Beliefs of the impact of Select a drink amount: of alcohol per week on the risk of health conditions, Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n#: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed\nSource: PAAHS 2023\n\n\n\nGeneral beliefs about alcohol and health conditions\nPeople tended to believe that higher levels of alcohol consumption increased their risk for any of the listed health conditions. Similarly, they were more inclined to believe that low levels of alcohol consumption (1 to 2 standard drinks per week) had no impact on risk. Some people believe that alcohol decreases the risk of health conditions, especially at low levels of consumption. For example, 6% of people believed 1 to 2 standard drinks per week decreased their risk of heart disease.\nPeople tended to believe that alcohol \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of the amount consumed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increased their risk for:\n\nharm to a fetus during pregnancy\nliver disease\nbeing overweight or obese\ndiabetes\n\nPeople were less likely to believe that alcohol increased their risk for:\n\narthritis\nmouth cancer\nthroat cancer\nbreast cancer\n\nAcross all levels of consumption, roughly one-third of people weren't sure about the impact of alcohol on their risk of:\n\nhigh cholesterol\ncolon cancer\nbreast cancer\nthroat cancer\nmouth cancer\narthritis\n\nAwareness of cancer risk\nIf a respondent already knew that alcohol increases the risk of breast, colon, throat, or mouth cancers, they were asked when they first became aware of this: \n\nmore than a year ago (56%)\nin the last year (16%)\nin the last month (8%)\nin the last week (1%)\ndidn't know (18%)\n\nMost people who already knew of the increased risk of cancer from alcohol, reported that they first learned about it from: \n\nTV or radio (39%)\nprint newspapers or magazines (13%)\nhealth care settings (10%)\nschool (8%)\nnon-social media websites (6%)\nsocial media (5%)\n\nNotably, school was the first source of this information for many 16 to 19 year olds (34%) and 20 to 24 year olds (22%). TV or radio was the first source for a large proportion of 25 to 49 year olds (37%) and people aged 50 years and older (46%).\nAwareness of risk by sex, age and alcohol consumption status\nAwareness of risk associated with alcohol consumption differed by sex, age and alcohol consumption status. More female respondents than male respondents believed alcohol increased their risk of certain health conditions such as breast cancer or harm to a fetus during pregnancy. These differences between males and females were more pronounced for lower levels of consumption (1 to 2 or 3 to 6 standard drinks per week).\nYouth were also more likely to believe that alcohol increases the risk of certain health conditions. For instance, 60% of 16 to 19 year olds believed that 1 to 2 standard drinks per week increases the risk of heart disease. This is in contrast to the proportion of other age groups with the same belief (51% of 20 to 24 year olds, 44% of 25 to 29 year olds, and 41% of those aged 50 years and older).\nSimilar patterns of awareness were observed for high cholesterol, liver disease, being overweight or obese, and harm to a fetus during pregnancy (Figure 4). Former consumers were more inclined than current consumers to believe 1 to 2 and 3 to 6 standard drinks per week increase the risk of health conditions. At higher levels of alcohol consumption (7+ standard drinks per week), perceptions of risk were similar across these groups.\n\nAdditional information on the awareness of risks is available in the archived report.\nHealth labelling of alcohol products\n\nFigure 5. Images of labels shown to respondents (from left to right: warning label, standard drinks label, risk label)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText description\nImages of labels displayed from left to right:\n\nWarning label: Health Canada advises that alcohol causes cancer, including breast and colon cancers\nStandard drinks label: 750 ml at 12% alcohol by volume equals 5 standard drinks, and 750 ml at 15% alcohol by volume equals 7 standard drinks\n\nRisk label: The risk of consequences caused by alcohol increases with the number of standard drinks you have per week:\n                                \n1 or 2 standard drinks per week is low risk\n3 to 6 standard drinks per week is moderate risk\n7 or more standard drinks per week is high risk\n\n\n\n\n\nAll respondents were asked a series of questions related to the health labelling of alcohol products.\nHealth warning labels and considering harms\nOverall, 75% of people indicated a health warning label would make them think about the harms caused by alcohol. This increased slightly to 77% when they were shown an example warning label (Figure 5). While there were no meaningful differences by age, women and former consumers of alcohol were more likely to report that this labelling would make them think about harms to a large or extremely large extent.\nHealth warning labels and considering cutting back\nOverall, 68% of people said that a warning label would make them think about cutting back on their own drinking or talk to others about cutting back on their drinking. This increased slightly to 72% when they were shown an example warning label (Figure 5). Women and former consumers were more likely to report that the label would make them do so to a large or extremely large extent.\nStandard drink labels and tracking drinks\nMore than half of people (57%) said they would use a standard drink label (Figure 5) to help them track their consumption of alcohol. Youth 16 to 19 years (70%) were more likely than other age groups to say they would use this label. There were no meaningful differences by gender or alcohol consumption status.\nRisk labels and considering cutting back\nAbout three-quarters (74%) of people said that risk labels with drink limits (Figure 5) would make them think about cutting back on their own drinking or talk to others about cutting back on their drinking. Women and former consumers were more likely to report that the risk label would make them think about harms to a large or extremely large extent.\nSupport for the health labelling of alcohol products\nFor all health labelling questions, most people agreed or strongly agreed that alcohol should provide more labelling information (Figure 6). Specifically, they showed the greatest agreement for labels showing:\n\nthe number of standard drinks (62%)\nguidance to reduce health risks (60%)\nhealth warnings (55%)\n\nOn the other hand, some people disagreed or strongly disagreed with labelling of alcohol, including:\n\nhealth warning labels (24%)\nrisk labels (21%)\nstandard drinks labels (19%)\n\nMore than half of people (59%) believed that alcohol should not be exempt from the health information labels required for other regulated products, such as tobacco and cannabis. \n\nAdditional information on the support for health labelling is available in the archived report.\n\nFigure 6. Support for various health labels on alcohol products: Select a survey question: for Select a survey category:, Canada, PAAHS 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n#: High sampling variability - although an estimate may be determined from the table, data should be suppressed\nSource: PAAHS 2023\n\n\n\n\nTechnical notes\nSex and gender\nRecognizing that the risks, effects, influences, and consequences of alcohol use can vary based on biological sex and gender identity (see Survey notes), we use the terms: \n\n\"female\" and \"male\" when referring to sex-related results\n\"women\" and \"men\" when referring to gender-related results\n\nStatistical considerations\nDifferences are reported when found to be statistically significant (pooled two proportion z test, where p\u22640.05) with a non-trivial effect size (Cohen's h, where h\u22650.2). This ensures that the results are both reliable (not due to chance) and meaningful (the difference has practical significance). To improve readability of the key findings, the term \"statistically significant\" is not repeated and the effect size is not reported. Where thresholds for significance and effect size are met, the difference between 2 estimates is referred to as \"meaningful\". At times, the findings say that differences are not meaningful even if the numbers are different. This means the difference lacks statistical and/or practical significance. Due to rounding or multiple responses, percentages may not always add up to 100.\nDefinitions\n\n\nAlcohol consumption status:\n\n\"Consumers\" of alcohol are those who have consumed alcohol in the past 12 months\n\"Former consumers\" are those who have consumed alcohol in their lifetime but not in the past 12 months\nPeople who have never consumed alcohol are included in the overall sample but excluded from the analysis by alcohol consumption status, which focuses on consumers and former consumers\n\n\n\nAlcohol drinking guidelines:\n                        In 2011, the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction issued Canada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines (LRDG)Footnote 2, designed to help people make informed decisions about alcohol. In 2023, the Centre updated and rebranded these guidelines as Canada's Guidance on Alcohol and Health (CGAH)Footnote 1, based on the latest research regarding alcohol-related risks. In this summary, \"alcohol drinking guidelines\" refer to both the LRDG and the CGAH. The questionnaire asked respondents about their awareness of either, without distinguishing between them (see Survey notes)\n                    \n\nStandard drinkFootnote 1:\n                        In Canada, a standard drink is 17.05 millilitres (ml) or 13.45 grams of pure alcohol. This is the equivalent of:\n                        \na bottle of beer (12 oz., 341 ml, 5% alcohol)\na bottle of cider (12 oz., 341 ml, 5% alcohol)\na glass of wine (5 oz., 142 ml, 12% alcohol)\na shot glass of spirits (1.5 oz., 43 ml, 40% alcohol)\n\n\n\nHealth labelling:\n                        In this summary, \"health labelling of alcohol products\" refers to the potential addition of labelling information to show:\n                        \nthe number of standard drinks\nguidance to reduce health risks\nhealth warnings\n\n\n\n\nSurvey notes\nCGAH release\nThe Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction released new drinking guidance with significant media attention in January 2023, shortly before the survey's launch on February 13, 2023. The timing of this release likely influenced respondents' awareness of alcohol drinking guidelines: \n\nCanada's Guidance on Alcohol and Health (CGAH, 2023)\nCanada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines (LRDG, 2011)\n\nThe PAAHS did not distinguish between awareness of the LRDG and CGAH. Therefore, this survey offers a snapshot of awareness of alcohol drinking guidelines in general, following the CGAH release.\nSex and gender\nTo participate, respondents had to disclose their sex at birth to ensure a representative sample. They did not have to disclose their gender, although 75% chose to. This resulted in a larger sample for sex (n=9,812) compared to gender (n=7,398) in the analyses. \nData for transgender and non-binary respondents are not reported by gender as is done for men and women. This is because of the small sample size, a need to protect respondent anonymity, and to avoid poor quality estimates. Transgender and non-binary respondents are included in analyses of the sample overall and by age, sex and alcohol consumption status.\nOverrepresentation of alcohol consumers\nThe PAAHS aimed to achieve a specific quota for alcohol consumption, where 75% of respondents reported consuming alcohol in the past 12 months and 25% had not consumed alcohol in the past 12 months. This quota was based on data from the 2019 Canadian Alcohol and Drug SurveyFootnote 4. Ultimately, 85% of the final sample reported having consumed alcohol in the past 12 months while 15% had not, indicating some overrepresentation of alcohol consumers. This may be due to volunteer bias, as the survey's title may have attracted people more interested in discussing alcohol-related topics because they consume alcohol.\nHealth literacy assessment\nIn the PAAHS sample, 20% of respondents were identified as having low or possibly low health literacy on the Canadian adaptation of the Newest Vital Sign health literacy assessment toolFootnote 5. Previous research estimates 60% of Canadians have low levels of health literacyFootnote 6. Estimates for the overall sample should be interpreted with caution as people with adequate health literacy are overrepresented. For results by health literacy, please refer to the archived report.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe Public Awareness of Alcohol-related Harms Survey (PAAHS) was conducted by Nanos Research on behalf of Health Canada.\n\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nParadis, C., Butt, P., Shield, K., Poole, N., Wells, S., Naimi, T., Sherk, A., & the Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines Scientific Expert Panels.

People with DD often have greater health care needs compared to those without, including more hospitalizations. This is largely due to co-occurring health conditions.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures to control the spread of COVID-19 affected access to health care services across Canada. This was particularly true earlier in the pandemic. To better understand these changes in health service use in those with DD during the pandemic, this study compares trends in DD hospitalizations to all hospitalizations in Canada (except Quebec) between 2015/16 and 2021/22.\nFor context, DD hospitalizations accounted for fewer than 1% of all hospitalizations each year between 2015/16 and 2021/22. Over half of DD hospitalizations were for males and over half were in people aged 18 or younger.\n\n\nNote: In this study, developmental disorder (DD) hospitalizations refers to hospitalizations that contained at least one DD code from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canada. See Technical notes tab for the DD case definition.\nThe study spans from fiscal years 2015/16 to 2021/22, with the following distinct periods:\n\nPre-pandemic period: 2015/16 to 2019/20\nPandemic period: first year (2020/21) and second year (2021/22)\n\n\n\nHow developmental disorder hospitalization rates changed during the pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile DD hospitalizations declined during the first year of the pandemic, they returned to pre-pandemic levels during the second year, except for those aged 12 to 18.\nDuring the first year of the pandemic, the decrease in DD hospitalizations was similar to that of all hospitalizations. However, the decrease in DD hospitalizations was greater for males and for children aged 7 to 11.\nIn the second year of the pandemic, DD hospitalizations increased more than all hospitalizations, particularly for females and youth aged 12 to 18. In fact, during the second year of the pandemic the hospitalization rate for this age group was significantly higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nThe largest changes in the monthly rate of DD hospitalizations were in the early months of the pandemic (April to June 2020).\n\nFor more details, refer to Results: How DD hospitalization rates changed during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nMost common reasons for developmental disorder hospitalizations before and during the pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the study period, mental and behavioural disorders were the most common reason for hospitalization among DD hospitalizations. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was the most common of these disorders.\nThere was an increase in DD hospitalizations for mental and behavioural disorders over the study period.\nThere was a decrease in DD hospitalizations for respiratory diseases during the pandemic period.\nCompared to other age groups, youth aged 12 to 18 were more commonly hospitalized for mental and behavioural disorders throughout the study period.\n\nFor more details, refer to Results: Most common reasons for DD hospitalizations before and during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 cases among developmental disorder hospitalizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 1.5% of DD hospitalizations in 2020/21 had COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) while in hospital, compared to 3.2% in 2021/22. This was slightly less than all hospitalizations (1.8% and 4.1% respectively).\n\nFor more details, refer to Results: COVID-19 cases among DD hospitalizations.\n\n\n\nChanges in length of stay of developmental disorder hospitalizations during the pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the study period, DD hospitalizations were, on average, significantly longer compared to all hospitalizations.\nLength of stay of DD hospitalizations was not impacted by the pandemic, except for those aged 7 to 11 in the first year of the pandemic and those aged 0 to 6 in the second year. For these groups, the length of stay decreased.\n\nFor more details, refer to Results: Changes in length of stay of DD hospitalizations during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nAs we learn more about the impact of the pandemic, it's important to continue to monitor these trends, and to investigate if the DD population experienced delays in care or any longer-term impacts. It's also important to monitor the increasing trend in hospitalizations for mental and behavioural disorders in this population. \n\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLonger-term symptoms of COVID-19 among Canadian adults\nSome people continue to experience symptoms after the acute phase of COVID-19 has ended.

A PTSD diagnosis requires a trained and licensed clinician to assess a specific set of signs and symptoms. PTSD may be diagnosed if symptoms persist for more than one month and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.Footnote 1\nThe Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events (SMHSE) was conducted to better understand how stressful events can impact a person's mental health. It collected information on self-reported exposure to specific PPTEs experienced, positive screens for PTSD (i.e. moderate to severe symptoms identified using a screening tool) and self-reported diagnoses of PTSD by a healthcare professional.\nData for cycle 1 of the SMHSE were collected among adults living in the 10 Canadian provinces, from August to December 2021.\nThis data blog also provides more detailed tables on the data from the SMHSE. To see these tables, visit the \"Data tables\" tab above. To download versions that include 95% confidence intervals, click on the ZIP icon above. \nFor details about measurement of PPTEs and PTSD, see the \"Technical Notes\" below.\n\nSummary of findings from SMHSE cycle 1 (August to December 2021)\n\n\n\n Prevalence of PPTE types\n\n64.9% of adults in Canada reported experiencing at least one PPTE type in their lifetime.\nThe most commonly reported PPTE types were:\n                                \ntransportation accident (35.3%) \nphysical assault (18.5%)\nlife-threatening illness or injury (18.4%)\n\n\nSome PPTE types were much more common among women*, notably:\n                                \nsexual assault (15.4% among women; 4.4% among men)\nother unwanted sexual experience (23.4% among women; 6.4% among men)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prevalence of PTSD diagnosis\n\n6.8% reported having received a diagnosis of PTSD by a health professional at any point in their lifetime.\n\n5.4% reported currently being diagnosed with PTSD by a health professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevalence of screening positive for PTSD\nOverall\n\n8.0% of adults in Canada screened positive for PTSD (i.e., had moderate to severe symptoms).\n\nBy age and gender*\n\n10.2% among women, compared to 5.7% among men. \n13.6% among those aged 18 to 24, compared to 3.3% among those aged 65+.\n\n\nBy sociodemographic characteristics\n\n9.9% among those in the lowest third of household income, compared to 7.5% and 7.0% for the middle and highest third, respectively.\n9.1% among those with more than high school but less than university and 8.9% among those with high school or less, compared to 6.4% among those with a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree or higher.\n12.1% among those who never married, compared to 10.2% among those who were separated, divorced, or widowed and 6.0% among those who were married or living common law. \n9.0% among non-immigrants, compared to 5.3% among immigrants.\n\n\nBy health and mental health factors\n\n22.7% among those who rated their general health as fair or poor, compared to 5.8% among those who rated their general health as good, very good, or excellent.\n28.9% among those who rated their general mental health as fair or poor, compared to 2.9% among those who rated their general mental health as good, very good, or excellent.\n26.8% among those who reported having a current diagnosis of a mood and/or anxiety disorder, compared to 3.2% among those who did not. \n18.4% among those who reported daily or almost daily heavy drinking in the past month, compared to 8.8% and 6.0% among those who reported less than daily heavy drinking and no heavy drinking, respectively. \n24.4% among those who reported daily cannabis use in the past month, compared to 13.9% and 6.3% among those who reported less than daily and no cannabis use, respectively. \n26.1% among those who reported ever having seriously contemplated suicide, compared to 4.5% among those who did not. \n25.6% among those with a low level of social support, compared to 5.4% among those with a high level of social support. \n\n\nBy type of PPTE\n\nThe PPTE types with the highest prevalence of screening positive for PTSD were:\n\ncaptivity (37.2%)\nsexual assault (28.9%)\ncausing serious injury, harm or death to someone else (28.4%)\n\n\n* Respondents were also given the option to report a gender identity other than man or woman. Those who did so were excluded from all analyses for confidentiality reasons.\n\nTechnical notes\nPotentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTEs) were assessed with a modified version of the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5).Footnote 2 Respondents were asked if they had directly or indirectly experienced each of a list of 17 PPTEs in their lifetime. Those who had experienced at least one PPTE were then asked about symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on the PPTE they identified as the worst they ever experienced.\nScreening positive for PTSD means scoring higher than 32 (out of 80) on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5),Footnote3 indicating moderate to severe symptoms of PTSD in the past month. While a diagnosis of PTSD requires a trained and licensed clinician, a validated screening tool such as the PCL-5 can identify individuals who may have PTSD but would need further assessment to confirm a diagnosis.\nRespondents in the Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events (SMHSE) were asked about conditions, including PTSD, that had been diagnosed by a health professional that had already lasted, or were expected to last, 6 months or more. A current diagnosis of PTSD means the individual currently has a PTSD diagnosis and a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD means the individual either currently has a PTSD diagnosis or had a PTSD diagnosis at some time in the past.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nFederal framework on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\nMental health support: Get help\nPTSD Coach Canada\n\n\nReferences\n\nFootnote 1\n\nHeber A, Testa V, Groll D, Ritchie K, Tam-Seto L, Mulligan A, Sullo E, Schick A, Bose E, Jabbari Y, Lopes J, Carleton RN.
