[11/juin/2024:18:06:40] . Extract: Fireworks-related injuries: data blog: Summary of statistics highlighting injuries associated with fireworks and other related products. Last updated: 2023-06-29 Fireworks and other pyrotechnic products have gained much popularity in Canada. With their impressive auditory and visual effects, it is not surprising that such products play important roles in celebrating special events. From the Inuvik Sunrise Festival in the Northwest Territories to the Canada Day celebrations occurring in many regions across Canada, such displays attract and amaze large crowds. However, when proper safety precautions are not taken, injuries can occur placing the health of individuals at risk. Presented below are statistics highlighting injuries associated with fireworks and other related products, such as sparklers and firecrackers, reported between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023 in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database. For information on fireworks safety, please see this fireworks safety video. How many cases were there? Between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023, there were 210 reported cases of injuries related to fireworks and other similar products, representing 11 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Age groups Young adults between the ages of 20 and 29 years represented the largest proportion at 22 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records but were closely followed by those aged of 30 and 39 years, who represented 18 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Males vs. females Overall, 67.1% of the patients injured were male (n = 141). Days of the week injury occurred Over half of all injuries (57.1%) occurred on a Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Time of year during which injury occurred Approximately two-thirds of all injuries (66.2%) occurred between May and August. Nearly a third of all injuries (29.0%; n = 61) occurred on days surrounding Victoria Day (May 16 to 24) and Canada Day (June 29 to July 3). Most common injuries The most common type of injuries were burns, representing 61.0% of cases (n = 128), followed by eye injuries at 19.1% (n = 40). Of the 128 burns, the most affected body region was the upper extremity region (hands, fingers and forearms), which represented 55.5% of such cases (n = 71). The head and neck region then followed, representing 25.0% of burns (n = 32). Thirty-eight individuals (18.1%) sustained burns in multiple body regions. What level of in-hospital treatment was needed? Nearly three-quarters of all cases (73.8%) required medical treatments in the emergency departments, and 11.4% of patients were admitted to hospitals. Take note CHIRPP is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 10 general hospitals across Canada. Since its inception in 1990, this database has colected over 4.2 million records, making it an important resource for information on injuries and moving forward programs and policies that aim at reducing and preventing injuries among Canadians. Learn more about the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program. Data extraction was conducted using English and French key word searches in the patientsâ narratives of the injury event and examining factor codes pertaining to injuries concerning fireworks and other related products. The results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all injuries related to fireworks and other similar products in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, MÃ©tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. More information and related material about fireworks use is available. You might also be interested in Injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation Analysis of such injuries. Drowning related deaths and injuries Statistics highlighting drownings. All Health Infobase data products Date modified: 2023-06-29. Answer: The article provides information on fireworks-related injuries in Canada. It highlights that fireworks and other pyrotechnic products can pose health risks if proper safety precautions are not taken. The data shows that the majority of injuries were burns, particularly to the upper extremities and head/neck regions. The article also notes that most of the injuries occurred during the summer months, with a significant number happening around Victoria Day and Canada Day celebrations. While the article presents some statistics, I cannot provide any numerical data as per the instructions. The key takeaway is that fireworks can be dangerous and it's important to exercise caution when using them. For more information on fireworks safety, the article recommends referring to a fireworks safety video..

Extract: should review this information in the data table before making conclusions. In specific cases, such as for cadmium and triclosan measured in urine, the analytical method used to measure chemicals has changed over time. Results for cadmium and triclosan in urine should not be directly compared across collection periods. Use caution when comparing creatinine-adjusted results for chemical biomarkers measured in urine. Creatinine levels differ by age and sex. We recommend that you only compare creatinine-adjusted levels for the same age group or sex across collection periods. Do not compare creatinine-adjusted levels across age groups or between sexes. For more information on considerations for interpreting the biomonitoring data, please see the Sixth Report on Human Biomonitoring of Environmental Chemicals in Canada. Human biomonitoring Human biomonitoring is the measurement of environmental chemicals in body fluids or tissues. This includes the parent compounds or their breakdown products, also known as metabolites. An environmental chemical is a chemical substance, either human-made or natural, that is present in the environment and which humans may be exposed to through air, water, food, soil, dust or consumer products. The primary purpose of human biomonitoring is to estimate chemical exposure levels within a population. This information helps scientists, health professionals and policy makers evaluate exposures and develop policies to protect the health of people in Canada. Data from multiple collection periods can be used to track changes over time and assess the effectiveness of risk management actions. For new chemicals, national data are an important baseline, or starting point, for future monitoring and research. Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) National human biomonitoring data come from the CHMS. The CHMS is an ongoing national survey led by Statistics Canada, in partnership with Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. The CHMS is Canadaâs most comprehensive, direct health measures survey, and is designed to represent the Canadian population. Through personal interviews and the collection of physical measurements and biological samples, the survey provides data on indicators of: environmental exposures chronic and infectious diseases fitness nutritional status other factors The human biomonitoring component of the CHMS measures environmental chemicals in blood or urine. Data are collected in 2-year collection periods (also known as cycles). Chemicals were selected for inclusion in the survey based on one or more of several considerations, including: known or suspected health effects level of public concern evidence of chemical exposure in the Canadian population new or existing requirements for public health action ability to detect and measure the chemical or its breakdown products in people similarity to chemicals monitored in other national and international programs known data gaps costs of performing the analysis Chemicals can be rotated in or out of different collection periods. In some cases, chemicals have been measured in multiple collection periods to track changes over time or obtain a larger number of samples necessary for data analysis. In other cases, chemicals were removed and may be added back in later collection periods. Suggested citation Health Canada. 2023. Canadian Biomonitoring Dashboard. Ottawa, ON.

Extract: Injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation: Summary of statistics highlighting injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation. Last updated: 2024-05-07 Injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation continue to be a public health concern. This household item can pose a health risk to individuals, as metal bristles can detach from the brush and remain on the grill. If left unnoticed, these metal bristles can then be transferred to food and be consumed. Though rare, these injuries can result in serious health complications. The numbers presented below are an updated analysis of such injuries using the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) surveillance system. The original analyses appeared in the October 2017 issue of the Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention journal (Volume 37 No. 10). 45 emergency department visits Incidents are still being detected.

Sample Narratives The actual number of individuals who have experienced injuries related to barbecue brush bristle ingestion/inhalation is unknown, as some might seek care at facilities other than emergency departments or might not seek care at all. Sample narratives of the injuries reported to CHIRPP are listed below and are reported in the language of the patientâs own account of events. These include: Eating burger, found barbecue brush bristle in mouth, feels like one in throat. Patient ingested some pins from the BBQ brush. Eating barbecue pork, bristle from brush used to clean barbecue got lodged at base of tongue and adenoids. Eating BBQ food; metal bristle from BBQ brush stuck on food; bristle stuck in esophagus. Had barbecued hamburger, brush bristle lodged in throat. Prevention Caution should be exercised when using metal bristle barbecue brushes due to the potential health and safety risks associated with metal bristles detaching and adhering to grills or cooked food items. To minimize the risk of issues with your metal bristle barbecue brush: regularly inspect your brush for signs of damage inspect grills and barbecued food for loose metal bristles replace metal bristle barbecue brushes every season stop using your brush if metal bristles come loose or stick to the grill consider buying a non-metal bristle barbecue brush as there are now many new alternatives being offered by retailers For more information on barbecue brush safety and recall updates, please visit Healthy Canadians. Voluntary safety standard In an effort to reduce the health risks associated with metal bristle barbecue brushes, Health Canada and the Retail Council of Canada commissioned the Standards Council of Canada to develop new national voluntary safety standards for such products. A public review of the draft safety standard was conducted in the summer of 2019 and the "CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes" standard was released in December 2019. The "CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes" standard provides requirements for the performance, testing, and marking of hand-held barbecue grill brushes with metal bristles and replacement heads. The standard specifies requirements for: wire bristle tuft attachment strength wire bristle durability replacement heads permanent on-product warning requirements requirements for instructional literature Although the "CSA Z630:19 Barbecue grill brushes" standard is a voluntary standard, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to monitor incidents and injuries due to metal barbecue grill brushes. You might also be.

Injuries from winter sports and activities Published: (2024-02-12) Winter in Canada provides favourable weather conditions for outdoor sports and recreational activities, including skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and sledding. While there are numerous health benefits resulting from these sports and activities, there are also risks of serious injuries.reference1-3 These risks highlight the importance of personal safety, such as wearing appropriate clothing and safety equipment, and ensuring your gear is in good condition. For more information on winter safety tips, please visit the following sites: Be prepared for winter weather Ice safety Sports gear safety tips Winter outdoor safety Skiing and snowboarding safety tips This data blog presents injury statistics on popular winter sports and activities captured in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) between October 1, 2016 and January 11, 2024. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system capturing injuries and poisonings presenting in 20 emergency departments across Canada. Every year, approximately 170,000 injury and poisoning records are entered in the database, from which information on the circumstances, types and emergency department outcomes of injuries can be examined. In this data blog, records with injuries related to sledding/tobogganing, ice skating, alpine skiing and snowboarding were examined. Sledding/tobogganing Ice skating Alpine skiing Snowboarding Sledding/tobogganing Ice skating Alpine skiing Snowboarding Sledding/tobogganing: Overall Between October 1, 2016 and January 11, 2024 there were 4,376 sledding/tobogganing-related injuries reported in the CHIRPP database, representing 556.0 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Of these injuries, the mean age was 10.0 years and males represented 54.4% of case. Among children, those aged 5 to 9 years represented nearly half of all cases at 43.6% (Table 1). Where reported, 7.5% (n = 327) of those injured stated that they were wearing safety equipment when the injury occurred.reference1 Table 1.

Answer: Based on the information provided in the article snippet, the latest CPHO (Chief Public Health Officer) report does not seem to be directly addressed. The article appears to contain data from the Canadian Housing Survey and covers various aspects of housing and neighborhood conditions, such as air quality, water quality, satisfaction with dwelling and neighborhood, perception of safety, homelessness, and neighborhood issues. However, it does not mention the CPHO report specifically. I do not have enough information to directly answer where you can find the latest CPHO report. I would suggest checking government websites or contacting the relevant health authorities to inquire about the availability and access to the latest CPHO report..

However, when proper safety precautions are not taken, injuries can occur placing the health of individuals at risk. Presented below are statistics highlighting injuries associated with fireworks and other related products, such as sparklers and firecrackers, reported between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023 in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database. For information on fireworks safety, please see this fireworks safety video. How many cases were there? Between April 1, 2011 and April 13, 2023, there were 210 reported cases of injuries related to fireworks and other similar products, representing 11 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Age groups Young adults between the ages of 20 and 29 years represented the largest proportion at 22 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records but were closely followed by those aged of 30 and 39 years, who represented 18 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records. Males vs. females Overall, 67.1% of the patients injured were male (n = 141). Days of the week injury occurred Over half of all injuries (57.1%) occurred on a Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Time of year during which injury occurred Approximately two-thirds of all injuries (66.2%) occurred between May and August. Nearly a third of all injuries (29.0%; n = 61) occurred on days surrounding Victoria Day (May 16 to 24) and Canada Day (June 29 to July 3). Most common injuries The most common type of injuries were burns, representing 61.0% of cases (n = 128), followed by eye injuries at 19.1% (n = 40). Of the 128 burns, the most affected body region was the upper extremity region (hands, fingers and forearms), which represented 55.5% of such cases (n = 71). The head and neck region then followed, representing 25.0% of burns (n = 32). Thirty-eight individuals (18.1%) sustained burns in multiple body regions. What level of in-hospital treatment was needed? Nearly three-quarters of all cases (73.8%) required medical treatments in the emergency departments, and 11.4% of patients were admitted to hospitals. Take note CHIRPP is an injury and poisoning sentinel surveillance system operating in the emergency departments of 11 paediatric and 10 general hospitals across Canada. Since its inception in 1990, this database has colected over 4.2 million records, making it an important resource for information on injuries and moving forward programs and policies that aim at reducing and preventing injuries among Canadians. Learn more about the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program. Data extraction was conducted using English and French key word searches in the patientsâ narratives of the injury event and examining factor codes pertaining to injuries concerning fireworks and other related products. The results presented above should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent all injuries related to fireworks and other similar products in Canada. CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. Injuries involving Indigenous peoples including Inuit, MÃ©tis and First Nations and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the CHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP hospital sites are located in major cities. Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the CHIRPP database as the emergency department data do not capture deaths occurring before being taken to the hospital or after being admitted via another department. Information is continuously entered into the CHIRPP database; therefore, some years do not yet have complete data. More information and related material about fireworks use is available.

[11/juin/2024:19:53:30] . Extract: symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on the PPTE they identified as the worst they ever experienced. Screening positive for PTSD means scoring higher than 32 (out of 80) on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5),Footnote3 indicating moderate to severe symptoms of PTSD in the past month. While a diagnosis of PTSD requires a trained and licensed clinician, a validated screening tool such as the PCL-5 can identify individuals who may have PTSD but would need further assessment to confirm a diagnosis. Respondents in the Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events (SMHSE) were asked about conditions, including PTSD, that had been diagnosed by a health professional that had already lasted, or were expected to last, 6 months or more. A current diagnosis of PTSD means the individual currently has a PTSD diagnosis and a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD means the individual either currently has a PTSD diagnosis or had a PTSD diagnosis at some time in the past.
